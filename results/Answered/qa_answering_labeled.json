{"intervention":"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of wearables growth, and maybe conversely, How important is a rising installed base of wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple Health? And then I have a follow-up. Michael, it's Tim.","response":"The wearables have done extremely well. It was acceleration further from the previous quarter, so we're thrilled with the results. As to what's driving it, it's the totality that's driving it. For some people, it's about fitness. For some people, it's about health. For some other people, it's about communication. For some people, it's all of the above. I think the new feature of Always On on Series 5 is a game changer for many of our users. In terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app. It really democratizes the information about people's health so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. We've got the research going that I mentioned earlier. There will be more of those through time. And obviously we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet. that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.","label":[{"question":"Do you think health-related features are a primary driver of wearables growth?","answered":"partially"},{"question":"How important is a rising installed base of wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple Health?","answered":"yes"}]}

I just wanted to start off with one of the new services, Apple Arcade, and if you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period, also how your partnerships with developers progressing there, how does the pipeline look like, and any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?","response":"We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that entered the trial period. People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so, and so it's really too early to tell. what the conversion rate will be. But I feel like we're off to a good start, and the most important of everything, the customer feedback to date has really been incredible, and we're very excited for the future of the service.","label":[{"question":"Do you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period?","answered":"partially"},{"question":"How are your partnerships with developers progressing there?","answered":"no"},{"question":"How does the pipeline look like?","answered":"no"},{"question":"Any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?","answered":"no"}]}
{"intervention":"Great. As a follow-up, if I can try and attack the wearables question with another angle, what are you seeing in terms of consumer behavior in upgrading wearables like Apple Watch or AirPods, and how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?","response":"I think because the watch is relatively young, we haven't seen enough upgrade cycles. establish a pattern as yet. And as I mentioned before, three out of four customers buying an Apple Watch currently, or last quarter I should say, were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there's still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. I do think the upgrade market will get larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to as to how often and so forth. On the AirPods, we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPod Pro, but I would guess that one, particularly in the early going, will be people that have AirPods today and want to also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.","label":[{"question":"What are you seeing in terms of consumer behavior in upgrading wearables like Apple Watch or AirPods, and how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?","answered":"partially"}]}

And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying an applicable device versus charging for it? And my congrats to Nancy, and thank you.","response":"Yeah, it's a gift to our users, and from a business point of view, we're really proud of the content. We'd like as many people as possible to view it, and so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going, and so we feel great about doing that. I think it's a bold move, and And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. You think about the quality of content that you get for $4.99, and it's amazing. It is amazing.","label":[{"question":"Can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying an applicable device versus charging for it?","answered":"yes"}]}
{"intervention":"Yep. Thanks a lot, guys. I guess two questions for me as well. First one, Tim, if you think about the services business, you're less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I'm wondering, if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the install base growing versus incremental monetization of the install base? And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?","response":"I think we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the install base. As Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter, and we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets. And so the install base is clearly a piece of it. Getting the trade in, program going and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. And, of course, ultimately the thing that builds the install base is to make customers happy. And that's always our top objective is to have satisfied customers. The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas the ARPU is increasing. And so as there's more offers out there, the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side. But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant and people love them. And so it's really both of those. And obviously, finally, in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to elect to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all three of those.","label":[{"question":"How much of the services business growth do you think was driven by the install base growing versus incremental monetization of the install base?","answered":"partially"},{"question":"Do you see that ratio flipping or changing as you go forward?","answered":"partially"}]}
{"intervention":"Got it. If I could just kind of go back to the variables discussion, especially as I think about Apple Watch and AirPods, Is there a sense or way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices, devices for Apple Watch or AirPods? I'm just trying to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone install base, what kind of penetration do you have at wearables and how long could this one may be as you go forward?","response":"Well, we're not releasing the precise numbers of our wearables, but it is a really nice try and get me to say that. The... What we're seeing in terms of new ads on the watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments, is about three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. And so we are still in significantly in the build mode there. And so you don't think of the penetration as anywhere near a sort of a mature penetration. We've got a lot left there. And the AirPods just keep hitting new highs. And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter, too. And we're really proud to add another product up there for people wanting noise canceling with the AirPod Pro beginning to sell today.","label":[{"question":"What is the current attach rate of Apple Watch or AirPods to iOS devices?","answered":"no"},{"question":"What is the current penetration of wearables among the iPhone installed base?","answered":"partially"}]}
{"intervention":"Thank you very much. First, Nancy, I just want to send you our best wishes. We'll definitely miss you. I'm sure I agree with Luca. You've been very instrumental over the years. My question is, though, with regard to China. And, I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, you know, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on, you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market. There's obviously some turmoil there. So if you could provide some more on China, that would be helpful. Thank you.","response":"Yeah, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. And so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus two last quarter. And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. And so there's a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be better. But but we feel good about how we're doing. I think it's a combination of things that have turned things around on a macro basis. I think the trade tension is less, and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have moved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that. I would also say it's not all about iPhone in China. The services area grew double-digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals. It's not all about quantity, but about which ones. We saw that. Also, wearables. Wearables are doing so great at a company level, they're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.","label":[{"question":"What are you seeing in China during the quarter?","answered":"yes"},{"question":"How has the reception to the iPhone been specifically in China?","answered":"yes"},{"question":"Do you have any thoughts on Hong Kong, which used to be a big market, given the current turmoil?","answered":"no"}]}
{"intervention":"Thank you. And then I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I'm just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend, and then is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? Thank you.","response":"Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles in some cases. Our revenue growth exceeds our OPEX growth. In other cases, like fiscal 19, it was the other way around. But our approach, frankly, is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business. Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience, differentiate our products. We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously... If you look at what we've launched in the last few quarters and few years, we've launched a lot of new products and now we're launching a lot of new services. And when we do that, we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services. And that... is what you're seeing, for example, in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we're launching new services right now. And so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.","label":[{"question":"Where are you targeting the incremental spend?","answered":"yes"},{"question":"Is there a point at which we might just see some leverage?","answered":"partially"}]}
{"intervention":"Yes, thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more. And even last year, given that iPhone is a slower-growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. So given the enthusiasm about... the iPhone 11 launch and the new wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism given that, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty in the world, and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considering?","response":"Tony, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing, if you look at it at the midpoint, implies an acceleration of growth from the from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal 19. As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. There's about a billion one of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind. We feel very good, as Tim said, about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of services also has incredible momentum. One thing to keep in mind, Tim, as we look at this guidance range, is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro a year ago for iPad, as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.","label":[{"question":"Why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line?","answered":"yes"},{"question":"Is that a reflection of conservatism given global uncertainty, or are there other factors to consider?","answered":"partially"}]}
{"intervention":"Okay, thank you for that. And then if I could follow up, just on the bundling of Apple TV+, I guess for you, Tim, You know, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and hardware offering. And I'm wondering if, you know, you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings, bundled offerings. And ultimately, you know, do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service? And maybe while we're on that, either you or Luca could give us the 30-second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting, approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring, and what's your expectation for a tax rate on that? Thank you.","response":"Let me cover that accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on Apple TV+, right? And we don't want to get into the details of that because we view those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive. But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors, including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't launched the service yet. We're going to start serving our customers tomorrow, so we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.","label":[{"question":"Do you view the bundling of hardware and services (like Apple TV+) as a strategic advantage of Apple?","answered":"no"},{"question":"Could you give a brief explanation of how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting for Apple TV+, including how much of the $60 you expect to defer?","answered":"yes"}]}
{"intervention":"Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. And, Nancy, our congratulations to you, too, and we're going to miss you. My first question is about pricing. the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year, and it looked like margins and the revenues did well on that. It also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well. So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect.","response":"Yeah, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well-received and do show a level of elasticity. But the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best lineup we've ever had in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them. is really incredible. And the photos I'm getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first, and then price sort of falls out of that. And we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. In terms of emerging markets, we picked sort of locally relevant prices, and in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would have reflected a while back instead of the current exchange rate. In other words, we tried to stay \u2013 as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those, in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion, have been extremely well received.","label":[{"question":"What does the response to recent iPhone pricing moves tell us about Apple\u2019s pricing strategy and willingness to be flexible to drive elasticity?","answered":"yes"}]}
{"intervention":"Thank you. Good afternoon. Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters. So can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.","response":"Yes, Katie, let me take that one.

How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about as the right run rate going forward?","response":"Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I would say disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions. So that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. Our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future. And we think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program, which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.","label":[{"question":"How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level?","answered":"yes"},{"question":"What should we think about as the right run rate going forward?","answered":"no"}]}

But I guess the question is, why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward, in part because that's almost one of your objectives, And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhone's average replacement cycle might be today and how that may have changed over the last three to five years.

{"intervention":"Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on the response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. In your opening remarks, Tim, you mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets. And then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program, or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and cogs and margins and things? Thank you.","response":"Yeah. Jim, in the opening remarks, I was really talking about China specifically. And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance...

{"intervention":"Yes, thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your install base on these trade-ins. What type of devices are being traded in? Is the profile, you know, someone who has a really old iPhone, or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in, and what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so and have a follow-up?","response":"Actually, the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. It's 6, 6+, 6S, 6S+, 7, 7+, and then fewer 8 and 8+... [respuesta completa incluida arriba]","label":[{"question":"What type of devices are being traded in?

{"intervention":"Thanks for the cover, Tim. And as my follow-up, Luke, can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or tailwind to your gross margins in the near term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds.","response":"Thank you. As Tim has explained, we've reached this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this, we have agreed that we're now going to share the financial terms of the agreement...
