You know, we really have only one real customer, one customer. And in my forecast, in my remarks so far in offload computing, it's pretty much very, very largely around one customer.

spk10,,,"Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start off with kind of a question on 5G. You're clearly excited about your position in 5G, but as you kind of think about the impact on the smartphone industry, you're expecting volumes to improve, but lowering the cost of the solution also is probably going to be a big driver. So how are you seeing kind of progress on that front? And just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned kind of 20 operators you expect to launch 5G. Can you just help us think about the mix of sub-6 versus millimeter wave? And you mentioned you expect millimeter wave to be mandatory. Kind of what's driving your view given what we hear is the infrastructure is not really ready to support millimeter wave in most geographies yet.",1929.58,1971.04,QCOM,2019,Q3,Question
spk09,Nick Modi,Analyst at RBC Capital Markets,"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. James, I just wanted to follow up on the last question regarding all the affordability packaging. Just based on the historical kind of observations across the world, how does it work with retail? I mean, are these incremental facings you're getting or is it replacing older pack sizes that might have a lot more price sensitivity?",2376.621,2399.966,KO,2022,Q4,Question

spk00,Rachel Battenstall,JP Morgan,"Great. And then my follow-up. I wanted to just press a little bit more on this pace of recovery within bioprocessing. So one of your peers has slowly been picking up their book to bill sequentially over the last few quarters. They just recently crossed that 1.0 level. That said though, Danaher is really one of the few companies or only that has been actively working with customers to manage their inventory levels. So while I appreciate that guidance, you know, isn't modeling a massive inflection at some point this year in bioprocessing, how should we think about that impact in managing your customers' inventory levels on what that does to the pace of recovery? And is there some reason why we shouldn't see more of a V-paced recovery, V-shaped recovery, excuse me, for Danaher? Thank you.",3154.869,3192.894,DHR,2023,Q4,Question
spk10,,,"um, not allowing it. I mean, the artists are the ones who are set the price of their tickets. Uh, it's our job to, to provide the information to them, to help them understand the market value of their tickets so they can figure out the balance that's right for them and their fan base in terms of, uh, pricing the tickets. So the, they're getting the value. Are they giving it to the fans? How do they keep it from going to the scalper? A lot of artists now, um, I would say it's almost becoming the standard that they're understanding they should price the front of their house to capture most of the value. Otherwise, it's the scalper who's going to take it. And then they want to make sure the back of the house is priced so that every fan can afford to buy a ticket and get in. The trend we've seen coming out of COVID is, I think, a switch from it being partially used to being very ubiquitous here in North America. And then over the past year or so, it becoming much more heavily adopted and in international markets. I think we still have a long ways to go in international markets towards full adoption. And if you look at the pricing with platinum, there's still a substantial gap relative to average secondary pricing, which would imply that artists are continuing to give a lot or attempting to give a lot of the value to fans. And we'll see how that evolves over time.",1456.936,1535.31,LYV,2023,Q2,Answer

I guess what's your outlook for that? And James, I know I always ask this, but with the rebound and the asset values, it seems like you sandbag with your pretax margin of 26%, 28%. Now 27% in the middle of that. But why not raise that target? Where do you think that will be ahead? And was there any noise in this quarter?",1365.16,1399.16,MS,2019,Q1,Question

And then just turning to Vogel, you know, the testimony by staff, I don't think you guys filed any rebuttal testimony, which is, I think, you know, sort of the normal course here, but without getting, not asking you to do rebuttal here or anything, but But in terms of this sort of the tension that they brought up about, you know, meeting milestones and the quality of work and what have you, would you say with this hot functional testing that if they were to look at the situation now after that, given what you guys have found, you know, how the plant performed with hot functional testing, that perhaps those issues would probably be diminished, if you follow my question? In other words, you mentioned that it performed very well.

spk29,Tony Will,President and CEO,"Yeah, let me let me take the first one first and then we'll come back to your second point. The first one not not really being a full on question, more of a statement. So every year we try to update the table based on what the relationship was in terms of margin per nutrient ton of the previous year. And so the table will naturally evolve up and down and sideways and whatnot based on previous year. It doesn't mean that that this is precise because if you know, if you weigh in search on a, you know, on a nutrient basis search trading at a premium to your via, then you know, the numbers are going to go up in every cell because of the volume of you weigh in that we sell. So this is illustrative as opposed to a, you know, to a point estimate. But, you know, your general comment of the relative premium of UAN versus Urea drop last year compared to where it was the year before is the right kind of takeaway. And that that's the basis and underline that sensitivity table on the second question. You know, we think that the price paid for Weaver is a is a fair but a full price for that asset. And, you know, our view is that at any point in time where we have made decisions to expand our network, someone could have made exactly the same argument that you just made, which is it's cheaper to buy back shares than it is to add capacity. Therefore, you should never add back or add capacity. That would have been true. You know, back in 2010 when we bought Terra, that would have been true when we acquired the medicine hat slice. So we didn't know that would have been true when we did the expansion projects at Donaldsonville in Port Neal or even probably the Wagman asset that was just acquired at every stage. You know that we have been able to invest capital and earn a rate of return well above our cost of capital. So that's a value adding transaction, whereas buying shares back at market price by definition is sort of NPV zero. You know, our view is if you look at the aggregate amount of cash that we generate and shareholder participation, sort of the ratio of the number of shares outstanding, our shareholders have been much better off based on the combined approach that we've taken to both disciplined, you know, add capacity and also take shares out of the marketplace. And that has created a lot of value relative to an exclusive pathway of one versus the other. And so we're going to continue to evaluate the, you know, the attractiveness of adding capacity on a basis of can we generate returns on a risk adjusted basis above our cost of capital? Because generating more cash flow simply allows larger share repurchases in the future. And it's not necessarily a point in time comparison about where we're trading in that moment because, you know, as you well know, these assets go 40, 50, 60 years in length. And so we really need to take a view of do we fully expect it to be a positive IRR NPV positive transaction to invest in a new plant? Because we can always default to buying shares back. And by the way, because of how well the business is operating, it's not an either or question for us. We can actually do both at the same time.",1379.58,1603.94,CF,2023,Q4,Question

And then maybe just on M&A, you know, you've been active in 2023, and congrats on Relievant and more recently Axonix early this year. I'm just curious on kind of how we should think about, you know, how aggressive and opportunistic you'll be over the next 12 months.

But do we kind of think of you guys in a little bit of a digestion period or kind of steady she goes, just as aggressive and opportunistic as you have been in the past?",2901.246,2934.991,BSX,2023,Q4,Question
spk10,Burt Frost,"Executive Vice President of Sales, Market Development, and Supply Chain","I agree with Chris. In terms of where we are in our evolution in this process, we're focused on the business and where we can generate higher revenues and higher profitability, and clean products are going to be a part of that, and it's amazing the receptivity from the processors. Again, when you look at the corn value chain in and of itself of what low-carbon ammonia or ammonia upgraded as UAN or as ammonium nitrate, what that can do in that value chain for corn or wheat as you take it through to the farmer and the farmer does beneficial practices that are being focused on today through the processor and as we sequester that CO2 from, let's say, the ethanol producer, you have a very low carbon finish product that can go into sustainable aviation fuel or ethanol.

spk01,Dr. Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. Well, hey, thanks for the question. I think it's fair to say that the semiconductor demand environment and particularly the AMD demand environment has been very strong in 2021. You know, we've been working on supply for the past couple of quarters. I think I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of increasing our supply. And, you know, what I've said previously is, you know, certainly, you know, we do see, you know, some level of constraints, but we are making progress each quarter. And we made progress in the second quarter that enabled us to exceed the original guidance And as we go into the second half of the year, you know, we're continuing to bring on extra supply each quarter, which is leading to, you know, the full year guidance raise that we have. So I think overall, you know, we continue to make progress. I will say that, you know, it's tight, like you've heard from many other companies, you know, through the end of this year. I think it improves in 2022. We've been planning for significant growth. You know, our model is one where we're going to drive significant growth. So we've been planning with that with our supply chain partners.

spk03,Neal Mitchell,Chief Financial Officer,"Thank you, David. Let me start with Collins. So you're right on the incrementals. We're expecting incrementals in that mid-30s percent range as we go through the year. Recall, we called out a few one-time items last year that probably helped margins by about 50 basis points, so good, strong incrementals there. Just hitting on a few of the components of our Collins outlook, we do expect that our commercial OE will be up sort of high teens on the sales line, commercial aftermarket up around 20% or so, probably a little north of that, and military up low single digits. As you think about Pratt, same thing, the incrementals there in the mid-20s, as you said, commercial OE expected to be up between 20% and 25%. The aftermarket side also between 20% and 25%, and as we said, military down mid-single digits. So again, great growth at Pratt. We do expect to ship probably about 200 more engines. And as I think about the NEM headwind, it's in the range of $100 to $150 million. So we're seeing good absorption as we ramp that volume back up over the course of 2022. And as Greg said, those supply chain issues at Pratt with respect to castings could result in a little bit of You know, lower deliveries here in the first quarter, but we do expect that full year we will be up a couple hundred engines.",1779.465,1869.708,RTX,2021,Q4,Answer

First, there was a data presented from Richter about negative symptoms improvement using RILAR. I was wondering what is your take on the data in terms of your ability to use it in the United States? Is it something that you're considering doing a trial on? Could this potentially be added to the label and so forth? And second, the growth in Botox neurology is really impressive. It seems relatively odd that there was such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in January, February for a physician-administered product. Can you just give us a flavor of what the underlying trends there? There's just a lot more success that you're having in pushing patients who failed CGRP into Botox.

But we really do a lot of different things in terms of partnering with our 200 plus partners on Clarice Juan. There's certainly an aspect of looking at cost and that's part of what we do for our customers to provide the best cost possible. But we're also working with our member partners in terms of making sure that we have the right supply. And so we'll do things to work with our partners to do long-term awards and other types of arrangements that are, again, a little more stability in terms of products. So I think there's a number of different things. It's certainly evolved over time. It's providing really good benefits in terms of best cost to our customers, but increasingly looking at supply and service levels has become just as important. It's important for us to make sure that when patients shows up at pharmacy counters that the product is there.

spk03,Lorenzo Simonelli,Chairman and CEO,"Yeah, James, and we feel good about the TPS orders outlook, and we do expect, as was mentioned, that we'll see double-digit order growth in 2022, and a lot of that driven by the LNG opportunities. You know, we've spoken about LNG before, and as you look at the outlook for 2030, we increased the capacity requirement of LNG to 800 MTPA.

spk00,John Hess,Chief Executive Officer,"Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. And we hope you and your families are well and staying healthy. Today, I will discuss our strategic response to the market downturn and the steps we are taking to manage in a sustained period of low oil prices. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Riley will follow to review our financial results. As we all know, the world has been battling a global pandemic and the danger it poses to society. Our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19. and also to those who are struggling with the loss of jobs. Our top priority throughout this crisis is the safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate. A multidisciplinary HES emergency response team has been overseeing our plans and precautions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in our work environment. We are grateful to every healthcare worker and first responder for all they are doing during this very difficult time. In addition, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the near-term oil demand, resulting in a sharp decline in oil prices. Our priorities in this low-price environment are to preserve cash, preserve capability, and preserve the long-term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged. with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel WTI and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To maximize the value of our production, we have charted three very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, to store 2 million barrels each of May, June, and July Bakken crude oil production. which we expect to sell in Asia in the fourth quarter of 2020. As announced on March 17th, we further strengthen the company's cash position and liquidity through a $1 billion three-year term loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. We also have a $3.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until the term loan comes due in 2023. We have further reduced our 2020 capital and exploratory budget down to $1.9 billion, a 37% reduction from our original budget of $3 billion. This reduction will be achieved primarily by shifting from a six-rig program to one rig in the Bakken by the end of this month and the deferral of certain exploratory and development expenditures in Guyana. Continue to operating one rig in the Bakken, our largest operated asset, will help us preserve our capability in lean manufacturing, which over the years has generated significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements. We plan to stay at one rig until WTI oil prices stabilize in a $50 per barrel range. In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Our top priority is Guyana, which is one of the industry's most attractive investments. On the Stabrook Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we have made 16 discoveries since 2015. The current estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the block stands at more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with multi-billion barrels of exploration potential remaining. The lease of phase one development achieved first production in December and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in June. The lease of phase two development remains on track for a 2022 startup with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Development of the Piara field with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, has been deferred 6 to 12 months pending government approval to proceed. In addition, pandemic-related travel restrictions have temporarily slowed our drilling campaign in Guyana. As a result, our production objective of more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day has been moved into 2026. In summary, our company is in a strong position to manage through this low-price environment and to prosper when the oil market recovers.

spk13,Karen Parkhill,Chief Financial Officer,"No, thanks for that question, David. In terms of margins, I did mention that we could see sequentially worse gross margins in the first quarter. And that's really as we think about the increased expenses due to COVID-19, along with the fact that, you know, should we choose to not run some of our manufacturing operations at full capacity, that we will have a potential move to period expensing some of the overhead in those manufacturing plants, as opposed to rolling it onto inventory in our balance sheet. And so that may cause margins in the first quarter to be a little bit worse than the fourth quarter. But we would expect to see margin improvement as we move into Q2, and then continued sequential improvement as we move into Q3 and Q4. And by the time we get to Q4, we would expect to be back to more normal margins on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned, FX has become more of a headwind for us this fiscal year, and really due to the strengthening of the dollar, particularly against emerging market currencies. And at this stage, we're looking at an FX impact of about 20 cents to the bottom line, which can obviously impact margins too. But we're really seeing good signs of recovery right now, and we're very excited about what the future can hold, even beyond FY21.",2645.96,2737.86,MDT,2020,Q4,Answer

Clearly, last week on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center to protect share. And I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean, in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point.

spk00,Adif Malik,Citi,"Thanks a lot. Jensen, I have a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously there are companies doing a lot of trading on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe on the high end at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 100 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? Thanks.",2484.538,2531.334,NVDA,2023,Q4,Question

But in the U.S. coffee business, we've seen this stabilization. There is a sequential improvement in pods. Specifically, I know you're talking about muted performance for the full year, but is there any reason to believe that going into the back half of the year, this stabilization to your mind would not sustain success? maybe even continue to improve as you fold in partners? And similarly, is there any reason to your mind that the pricing that we've seen, which dipped down a little bit, should materially improve into the back half? So it's a bit of opposite questions between the two. And if I could sneak this in, just given we're at the end of the call, but the back half in U.S. refreshment improvement, is there a way that you'd frame – The contribution from the distribution partnership ramp relative to innovation, is it mostly distribution and innovation, is a kicker.

spk08,Chuck Robbins,Chairman and CEO,"Okay. Thanks, Paul. Thanks for the four questions. Just kidding. Kelly, you'll talk about pricing and other things. Let me give you the broader answer, Paul. I think you're right. And, I mean, when you look at our results on an orders perspective and you see emerging countries up 16% in the face of a rising dollar, that's different than what we've seen historically when we were very – what I would say is we were directly connected to the global GDP and we moved with it. I think it – maybe this is the beginning of us answering the question that I've been asked the last two calls, which is how much of this is macro and how much of it is your own execution. When we begin to perform differently than what's perceived to be in the macro, I think that'll give us insight into how much of it is our execution, our innovation. The other thing I'd point out is that, and by the way, in the emerging countries, just to be clear, it was very consistent across the board. So we had incredible strength in, we did have incredible strength in India. It was our second quarter of 50% plus growth in India. So we have really We've done a great job there, and it's not just the large service providers. We had a large public sector deal this quarter, so that is a key market for us that we intend to win in, and the teams are doing a good job there. But I think the other thing to consider is that when you look at our customers, even in a tough economic environment, what is one of the things that you want to do when you're in a tough economic environment is you want to continue to drive cost and productivity in your business. And at the heart of the automation strategy and at the heart of some of the SD-WAN stuff and at the heart of re-architecting the infrastructure, the ending result is to drive cost out and drive productivity up. So it's unclear to me at this point, you know, what any sort of significant macro shift is going to do to the spending in this environment because it is connected to what you're trying to achieve when you do have a tough macro environment. So we're going to have to see how it goes, but... So that's that question. On the CAT 9K, look, we're still incredibly early. I mean, it's incredibly early. We just launched another product that addresses a market size similar to what we launched, you know, a year and a half ago. And so we're just on the front end of it. And as the customers adopt that architecture, then You're seeing, you know, we announced the wireless portfolio that's going to fit within that. In the spring, you'll see SD-WAN get integrated into the overall architecture in addition to the innovation we announced this week. So, you know, we feel good about where we are, and we'll see how the macro plays out.",1583.72,1734.033,CSCO,2019,Q1,Answer

There's an initial level of high-level, medium-level, and extraordinarily detailed planning that goes into an evolution like this. And then there's the initial hiring of the senior-most change agents, people with real experience, to augment the folks that we have in the field doing the work. And as Alan mentioned, this is This covers the entirety of the company. This isn't something that just happens in a group called risk. This happens in every line of business, in every function, dealing with every business process. So you plan it at varying levels of granularity, senior hiring, next level hiring. And by hiring, it can be people who already work here moving into slightly different jobs, but it's articulation of what those jobs are, what real roles and responsibilities are to accomplish the goals. And then you begin the execution phase. And the execution, again, is business by business, function by function, process by process.

It's still obviously at very heightened levels, but if you look at the trend quarter over quarter, it really narrowed down to less than a sort of 1% increase in inflation in our Q3 versus our Q2. So what we were pleased about was in that context, the continued momentum in our overall ID sales when we look at our Q3 performance versus our Q2. And I think a lot of that ties to some of the prepared remarks that Rodney also shared around household growth that we're seeing and really solidifying more share of wallet from loyal customers and seeing loyal customer growth. So that's the piece that I think we've been the most pleased around and we continue to perform really well with winning that first large basket with customers.

And the last piece I would say, just to add to the commercial model in our thinking, also has to do with the fact that we're also trying to get ahead of the game and better understanding, right? These are diseases that are that sometimes community physicians will not see on a regular basis and how do we make sure that we understand the when and where and making sure that the commercial model supports that timing as well and being a little bit smarter in our approach from an execution standpoint. So all those pieces are coming into play, but obviously we're excited and anxious for the data, but we will be sure that we are ready for not only the data, but the approvals as well.",3619.346,3694.402,GILD,2023,Q1,Answer
spk03,,,"Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael, just want to go back to make sure I have this correct. The implied fourth quarter guidance, you said it was going to be down sequentially relative to Q3. Can you be a little more specific as to what the midpoint implies? And then I'm kind of curious, as we're thinking about the year-over-year bridge relative to 21, I mean, last year in the fourth quarter, we had a 200 basis point hit from price-cost. This year, it seems like we're going to be soundly positive. So I'm sort of curious how we bridge that and then think about the incremental volume and also whatever is going on in terms of your internal initiatives that are flowing through.",2416.554,2461.919,ITW,2022,Q3,Answer
spk04,,,"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. In Peru, you know, there certainly seems to be a fair bit of issue, not specific to Yanacocha, but to just the mining industry in general about kind of a lack of investment and flow of monies earned back into local communities. Can you give us some colour in terms of what your stakeholder engagement has been like with your local communities that are impacted by Yannick Ocean. What, if anything, you're kind of planning to do differently if you do go ahead with a full funds decision on the Sol5 project?",3866.251,3904.584,NEM,2021,Q2,Question
spk13,Steve Powers,Analyst at Deutsche Bank,"Yes. Hey, good morning. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. Billy, I guess when you step back and you sum up the elective investments that you seem to be prioritizing in 21, both towards the vision of a non-combustible future and the new product development, but also just the enhanced analytics around consumer insights and revenue growth management, is there any way to dimension maybe even just relative to similar investments in prior years, whether whether we should be viewing 21 as a year of acceleration, investment acceleration on those fronts, or would you frame it more as a steady state glide path if you drew a line to the last two years?",2889.385,2933.328,MO,2020,Q4,Question
spk00,Eric Sheridan,Analyst at Goldman Sachs,"Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter, if I can. Looking at the results in the commerce business, there's a clear sort of pattern emerging with respect to ASPs versus unit growth. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and the propensity to be receptive to either lower ASP items or discounts among consumer behavior? And then the second part would be, can you talk a little bit about some of the strategic initiatives you're building for the long term around capitalizing on lower ASP items and the potential shift to more consumables in the base of consumption habits on the platform? Thanks so much.",2201.946,2237.196,AMZN,2024,Q3,Question

spk17,,,"And piggybacking off that, in the past, we've been looking at sort of a 40% long-term EBITDA margin bogey for lithium. And 1Q looks like a little bit of an anomaly, but Given the current price setup that you're seeing is there any meaningful change to your long term normalized margin outlook it's a bit higher in 2022 and and. If you could also talk about helping us, you know come up with a framework for quantifying how startup costs are going to play into that over the next few years, that would be really helpful.",2952.277,2987.936,ALB,2022,Q1,Answer
