"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income, and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion, or 9% from a year ago, in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets, including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in wearables, where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record, $12.7 billion, with double-digit growth in every geographic segment, and new all-time records across our portfolio. Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue, in spite of a negative 60 basis point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all-time record at $22.2 billion, up 2.3 billion, or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19%, and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of 56 billion grew 8% year-over-year as we saw great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Our active install base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., The latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services, we had an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services, and our App Store search ad business, and December quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year 16 services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run-rate basis with the results of the December quarter. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we are experiencing across our services offerings, we are increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. Upstore revenue grew strong double digits thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year over year. Our first-party subscription services also continue to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure, and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. Many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers. And we're very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users. Next, I'd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air, Mac Mini, and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channel fill. Despite the tough compare on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product. And the active install base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who are planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home, and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year, with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments, and growth across wearables, accessories, and home. We set all-time records for wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experienced some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter. We also continue to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications, and nursing workflows. And we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Ghost Surgical, which uses CoreML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during childbirth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both clinical outcomes and costs. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company which makes a handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions on the market today. Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with 207 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro denominated green bond, retired 1 billion dollars of maturing debt, and reduced commercial paper by 1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of 108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we will share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 and $67 billion. The wider-than-usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38 and 39 percent. We expect OPEX to be between $9.6 and $9.7 billion. We expect OIE to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate, to be about 16.5%. Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 77 cents per share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020, to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020. With that, let's open the call to questions.",Monologue
"Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",Procedure
"And welcome to the Apple Q2 fiscal year 2023 earning conference call. Today's call is being recorded. After this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Trindamalli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",Procedure
"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records including in Brazil, Malaysia, and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost, to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year over year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we track. Despite these challenges, we continued to manage for the long term, and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products, whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus continue to delight users with their long-lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries And I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life-saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chips throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power-efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro-level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design. And users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2-powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1-powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game-changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventurers, athletes, and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, service has set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Payment Services. And now with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize, and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on the Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway. With MLS season pass, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a stand-alone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, The premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony, just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later. Designed with users' privacy and financial health in mind, Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the U.S., we launched Shop with a Specialist over video A new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creatives, and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months. So many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us. And that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our racial equity and justice initiative. And every day, we're building an even more inclusive and diverse apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're also investing up to an additional $200 million and our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature-based carbon removal projects with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain We're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple-designed batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025. And we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",Monologue
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 5 percentage points on our results in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year over year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland, among others. Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India, to Latin America and the Middle East. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace, thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mixed shift towards services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend but remain focused on long-term growth. We continue the investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52 unchanged versus last year. And we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging microeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets, with India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We're very pleased by the results of the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Macro revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the install base of ActiveMacs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Also, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air, powered by the M1 chip in the year-ago quarter, and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad install base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year over year, as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the U.S. and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our watch install base which set a new all-time record thanks to very high customer loyalty and new-to rates. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, and in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising, AppleCare, and video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, Certain services offerings, such as digital advertising and mobile gaming, continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we're seeing across several key metrics. First, our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months, and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings, from new content on Apple TV+, to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchisor, originally started with iPhone to help employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees, and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in-house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software, and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business Week here in the U.S., we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. Net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of 129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suassini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. For an exchange, we continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44 and 44.5 percent. We expect OPEX to be between 13.6 and 13.8 billion dollars. We expect OINE to be around negative 250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments. and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of 24 cents per share of common stock, payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.",Monologue

"Marc Benioff, Thanks, Deborah, and thank you all for joining us today. This was a strong quarter, and our community and business continue to grow. There are now around 2.7 billion people using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger each month, and more than 2.1 billion people using at least one every day. We're continuing to see fast adoption of Stories, with each of our three stories experiences, Facebook and Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp, having more than half a billion daily actives. Since our last call, I've written about some major updates on the future of our services and how we're thinking about some of the important social issues facing the Internet. So I'll focus my time today on these, starting with our privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking. The basic idea here is that in our lives, We all have public spaces like the town square and private spaces like our living rooms. And in our digital lives, we also need both public and private spaces. For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalents of the town square, where you can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once, stay in touch with your friends, meet new people, find communities that share your interests, start businesses, buy and sell things, and organize fundraisers for causes. They aren't just tools for sharing one thing. They're these whole rich platforms for lots of ways to interact in larger communities. Today, people increasingly want the intimacy of connecting privately as well. So I think that there also needs to be a digital equivalent of the living room, a platform just as built out with all the ways that you'd want to interact privately. We already see that messages, small groups, and stories are by far the fastest growing areas of online communication. And we also know that people want additional tools for private interactions like payments and commerce. I expect the digital town squares like Facebook and Instagram will always be important and will only continue to grow in importance. But there's a lot more to build there as well, and I'm excited about that. But over time, I believe that there's an even bigger opportunity with the digital living room to build a platform focused on privacy. We all need to communicate privately, and this service could be even more important in our lives. So I think that we should focus our efforts on building this privacy-focused platform. Now, our plan is to build this the way we've developed WhatsApp, focus on the most fundamental and private use case, messaging, make it as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption, and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that. And this privacy-focused platform will be built around several principles. Private interactions, you should have simple, intimate spaces where you have complete confidence that what you say and do is private. Encryption. Your private communications should be secure, and end-to-end encryption prevents anyone, including even us, from seeing what you share. Reducing permanence. You shouldn't have to worry about what you share coming back to hurt you later, so we won't keep around messages or stories for longer than necessary. Safety. You should expect that we'll do everything we can to keep you safe on our services within the bounds of an encrypted service. So we're taking the time to get this right up front before we ship this platform. And interoperability, you should be able to use any of our apps to reach your friends, and you should be able to communicate across our networks easily and securely. And finally, secure data storage. You should expect that we won't store sensitive data in countries where it might be improperly accessed because of weak rule of law or governments that can forcibly get access to your data. So over the next few years, we're going to rebuild more of our services around these ideas. There are a lot of open questions and real tradeoffs on important social issues. So we're committed to working openly on this and consulting with experts and governments as we go. Now, I know one of the questions we've gotten frequently is about how this will affect our business. So I'll address that here. The reality is any impact is going to be longer term, and we don't know exactly how this will play out yet. But on some of the questions like whether encrypting content will hurt our business, I'm more confident that won't be a significant issue. We don't use the content of messages between people to target ads today, so encrypting that content won't change what we do. It'll strengthen people's privacy without meaningfully affecting our business. Similarly, reducing the permanence of data may have some impact, but we've generally found that more recent data is more useful for recommendations anyway, So this is another step that should have a much bigger impact on strengthening people's privacy than it will have on our business. Our stance on data localization is a risk. That is, if we get blocked in a major country, that will hurt our community and our business. But our principles on data localization aren't new, and this has always been a risk. Now, some people have asked whether more use of private social platforms will replace the more public platforms. And our privacy roadmap applies to all of our products. But we believe that there needs to continue to be both the digital town square and the digital living room. And as private platforms have grown, in some cases, we've seen some cannibalization of the more public platforms in countries like India, where WhatsApp is very popular. But the broader pattern across the world is that people want to use both private and public platforms. So I believe building out this private social platform is a much greater opportunity than it is a risk. In thinking about the opportunity and impact to our business, by far the most important factor will be whether people choose to use our products and whether we can build the leading private social platforms in most countries. Now remember, we are not currently the leading messaging platform in either the United States, China, or Japan, which are the three largest economies in the world. Our apps aren't in China, but innovating and succeeding in the other countries is going to be very important. People want a private social platform that is as strong on privacy as possible. So delivering this is both in the interests of our community and our business. As always, our first step is going to be to focus on building the services people want. We're still in the early stages of developing this, and we'll share more as our plans develop. The other piece I published in the last month was about the four areas of internet regulation I think would be most helpful around content, elections, privacy, and data portability. And the reason I wrote this is because I've spent most of the last couple of years focused on addressing the important social issues around the Internet. And while I'm proud of the progress we've made, these are areas where it doesn't feel right for a private company to make such important policy decisions by ourselves. If the rules for the Internet were being written from scratch today, I don't think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections, and data privacy without a more robust democratic process. For harmful content, I think there should be a public process for determining what's allowed and required for keeping harmful content to a minimum. That could be through government or industry, but having common standards is critical since people use so many different services to share content. For elections, there have long been laws defining what is political advertising, but we need to update those regulations to reflect today's threats, like the ways that foreign nation states try to interfere in elections now. Those threats are often not covered by today's laws, and I think we'd be better off if companies didn't define those policies themselves. For privacy, I believe it would be positive if more countries adopted regulation like GDPR as a common framework. At this point, realistically, most countries will adopt privacy regulation, and the most likely alternative to a global framework like GDPR is the fragmentation of the Internet and more countries following the approach of authoritarian regimes adopting strict data localization policies where governments can more easily access people's data. And I'm highly concerned about that future. For data portability, if you have data in one service, you should be able to move it to another. But we need a common understanding of nuanced questions like what is your data and what is someone else's? If I share my birthday with you, is that now your data that you should be able to bring to your calendar app so it can remind you later? Or is that only my data? And if a platform like Facebook facilitates data portability and you're bringing data to another app, whose responsibility is it if that app misuses your data? The absence of clear rules here discourages companies like ours from building tools to make it easier to move data between apps. These questions involve difficult tradeoffs. We can't have complete free speech, but no hate. We can't have complete privacy while also stopping every safety threat. We can't tell platforms to keep everyone's data private, but then expect a broad definition of data portability for research or competition. The values and equities at stake are too important and too conflicting for any company to balance them in a way that everyone will be comfortable with. So part of building trust will be deferring to a public process on how to make these trade-offs. I understand that any regulation may hurt our business, but I think it's necessary. Getting these issues right is more important than our interests. And I believe that regulation will help establish trust when people know that the right systems of governance and accountability are in place. So over the long term, I believe that that increase in the trustworthiness of the Internet can have a much larger positive impact for our community and our business than any short-term hit that we're going to take. Overall, this is an important time for Facebook. I'm excited about the direction we're heading and looking forward to discussing how we should address some of these issues more directly. As always, thank you for being on this journey with us, and now here is Cheryl to talk about our business.",Monologue
"Thanks, Cheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our community metrics. Facebook daily active users reached 1.56 billion, up 8% compared to last year, led by growth in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This represents approximately 66% of the 2.38 billion monthly active users in March. MAUs grew 179 million, or 8%, compared to last year. Turning to our family metrics, we estimate that on average, over 2.1 billion people used at least one of our apps on a daily basis in March, and around 2.7 billion people were active on a monthly basis. We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services. Turning now to the financials. All of the comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $15.1 billion, up 26% or 30% on a constant currency basis. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the first quarter of 2018, total revenue would have been approximately $503 million higher. Q1 total ad revenue was $14.9 billion, up 26%, or 31% on a constant currency basis. In terms of regional ad revenue growth, U.S. and Canada was strongest at 30%, followed by Asia Pacific at 28%, and rest of the world at 23%. Europe grew more slowly at 21% and was impacted in part by currency headwinds. In Q1, the average price per ad decreased 4%, and the number of ad impressions served across our services increased 32%. Impression growth was primarily driven by ads on Instagram stories, Instagram feed, and Facebook news feed. The year-over-year decline in average price per ad reflects an ongoing mixed shift towards stories ads and geographies that monetize at lower rates. Payments and other fees revenue was $165 million, down 4% year-over-year, and down 40% from Q4, which benefited from holiday sales of Oculus and Portal. Turning now to expenses. Total expenses were $11.8 billion, up 80%. This includes a $3 billion accrual taken in connection with the inquiry of the Federal Trade Commission into our platform and user data practices. This matter remains unresolved. and we estimate that the associated range of loss is between $3 billion and $5 billion. Absent this accrual, our total expense growth rate would have been 46 percentage points lower. We ended Q1 with approximately 37,700 full-time employees, up 36 percent. Operating income was $3.3 billion, representing a 22 percent operating margin. Absent the accrual, operating margin would have been 20 percentage points higher. Our Q1 tax rate was 30 percent and was higher than the mid-teens guidance given the tax treatment of the accrual. Net income was two point four billion dollars or eighty five cents per share. The accrual we recorded reduced EPS by approximately one dollar and four cents. Capital expenditures were four billion dollars driven by investments in data centers servers office facilities and network infrastructure. We generated five point three billion dollars in free cash flow. and ended Q1 with approximately $45.2 billion in cash and investments. In Q1, we bought back approximately $521 million of our Class A common stock. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We continue to expect that our revenue growth rates will decelerate sequentially throughout 2019 on a constant currency basis. In addition, we anticipate ad targeting related headwinds will be more pronounced in the second half of 2019. Turning now to the expense outlook. We are adjusting our expense outlook, which now includes the accrual we recorded in Q1. We now anticipate full-year 2019 total expenses to grow from 47 percent to 55 percent compared to 2018, up from our prior guidance of 40 to 50 percent growth. The $3 billion accrual accounts for approximately 10 percentage points of the anticipated expense growth. Thus, excluding the accrual, This revised outlook implies a modest adjustment in our guidance on 2019 core expense growth rate. Note that this does not change our longer-term outlook on the need to invest in core product, infrastructure, innovation, and safety and security, and the ultimate impact of those investments on our operating margin. We are updating our 2019 capital expenditures outlook to be $17 to $19 billion, down from our prior estimate of $18 to $20 billion. Our capital expenditures are driven primarily by our continued investment in data centers and servers. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of 2019 to be in the mid-teens. In summary, Q1 was another good quarter for Facebook. We are pleased with our ability to grow our community and business while at the same time investing heavily for the future. With that, Mike, let's open up the call for questions.",Monologue

"Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.",Procedure
"This was a good quarter for our product and business. There are now more than 3.5 billion people who actively use one or more of our services, and I'm excited about our product roadmaps ahead. I want to start today by discussing some of the themes that we're seeing in our major efforts around creators, commerce, and the next computing platform. Each of these areas is important and is going to unlock a lot of value on its own, but they're also building blocks for the future of the Internet and the future vision for our company, and I'll discuss that as well. So first, let's talk about creators. We want our platforms to be the best place for millions of creators to earn a living, and if we can do this, then our services will also have the best content across many different types of media, from text and photos to audio, gaming, and video. Video in particular is becoming the primary way that people use our product and express themselves. Now, I know this is a theme that we've been talking about for a few years now, but we've been executing on this for a while, and video has steadily become more important in our product. Video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook, and Reels is already the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. Across all forms of video, short form video like Reels is growing especially quickly. We're very focused on making it easy for anyone to create video and then for those videos to be viewed across all of our different services, starting with Facebook and Instagram first. People like to watch videos recommended by our personalized algorithms, so this gives creators a good way to reach new people who don't follow them yet. And this is also a good complement to our social feeds, And it's an area where our progress in AI is going to make the experience a lot better in the coming months and years. On-demand video, like in Facebook Watch, is also growing quickly and is now growing faster than other types of video or content in news feed. We're building a number of new video monetization tools for creators that can get compensated for making great content. So, for example, last year, people sent more than $50 million of stars to game stream creators going live on Facebook alone. And now we're expanding stars so fans can send them to any creator during on-demand video as well. I also want to call out live video for a moment. This is a smaller percent of our overall video on our services, but it's some of the most unique content and gives creators a way to build community and engage with their followers. And we're also focused on developing monetization tools like live breaks, for mid-roll ads and live shopping, so creators can make a living and engage their communities more deeply in commerce with their content. So overall, there's a lot more to do here, and as it becomes the majority of engagement across our services in the coming years, we're gonna continue to focus on this. We're also focused on other types of creators beyond video, and some of the most interesting emergent behavior that we're seeing is creators using a lot of different types of content to engage their communities. So we've launched live audio rooms this quarter, as well as podcasts. We also launched Bulletin, our publishing and subscription service for writers and with features to help them find and grow their audiences, including integrations with groups, Facebook Live and live audio rooms. To help grow the creator economy overall, we're gonna keep our creator tools free to use through 2023. And we recently announced that we're investing a billion dollars in creators across Facebook and Instagram. So I'm optimistic that creators will get more opportunities to do the work that they want, and that's going to lead to people hearing lots of new voices across our different services. The second area that I want to talk about today is commerce. Our goal here is to create better experiences for people interacting with businesses and to help businesses grow even more on our platform. Our approach is to work our way down the stack, and build world-class services at every layer of commerce, starting from discovery at the top of the stack all the way down to payments. And just like we want to be the best place for millions of creators to make a living, we also want to be the best place for businesses to grow as well. We started here by building world-class ads tools to help businesses reach potential customers and help people discover new products and services that they might like. But what we found is that when these ads link off-site, you often land on a webpage that's not personalized or not optimized or where you have to reenter your payment information. And that's not a good experience for people, and it doesn't lead to the best results for businesses either. So our next phase here is focused on building out shops, marketplace, and business messaging and WhatsApp and Messenger to create more native commerce experiences across our app. There's a lot of work here to do to support all of the business tools natively that already exist for the web. But as we bring more of this online and enable more of this, it's going to create a superior consumer experience, and it's going to convert better for businesses. This is going to lead to more businesses investing and building out their presences across our services, and that will lead to even more diversity of products for people to discover and interact with. So this is a long-term strategy. It's going to take a while before it's meaningful, especially given the scale of our ads business already, but I'm confident that it's the right long-term bet in product direction. And as we work our way down the stack from discovery and ads to native commerce storefronts, we're also making progress on payments at the same time. So WhatsApp payments, are now available to everyone in Brazil as well as India. Lots of people are already using this as a simple and secure way to send money to friends. We're adding new payments features in Messenger in the U.S. like QR codes. We also just announced that we're making Facebook Pay available outside of our apps for the first time, which means that you're going to start seeing it as a checkout option on the web and especially in web views that you see within our apps after clicking on ads or other business content. So commerce experiences are now accessible across most of our services, and we have a full roadmap of deeper integrations that I'm excited about in the months ahead. The third area I want to talk about is building the next computing platform. We're continuing to invest very heavily in building technology and products to deliver a full sense of presence. This is going to be critical for unlocking the next generation of social internet services. Quest 2 in particular continues doing well, and it keeps getting better monthly as we release regular software updates, including most recently our pass-through APIs so developers can start building mixed reality experiences on Quest. The range of content and experiences that we're seeing keeps broadening as well, to the point where there are a lot of popular virtual reality experiences beyond games at this point. The most popular apps on Quest are social, which fits our original thesis here that virtual reality will be a social platform, and that's why we're so focused on building it. But we're also seeing compelling use cases in other forms of entertainment as well, as well as work, creativity, and fitness. Looking ahead here, the next product release will be the launch of our first smart glasses from Ray-Ban in partnership with Essilor Luxottica. The glasses have their iconic form factor and they let you do some pretty neat things. So I'm excited to get these into people's hands and to continue to make progress on the journey towards full augmented reality glasses in the future. Now, the areas that I've discussed today, creators, commerce, and the next computing platform, they're each important priorities for us and they're each going to unlock a lot of value on their own. But together, These efforts are also part of a much larger goal to help build the metaverse. And I'll be sharing a lot more about this in months ahead. So I wanted to discuss this now so you can see the future that we're working towards and how our major initiatives across the company are going to map to that. So what is the metaverse? It's a virtual environment where you can be present with people in digital spaces. you can kind of think about this as an embodied internet that you're inside of rather than just looking at. And we believe that this is going to be the successor to the mobile internet. You're going to be able to access the metaverse from all different devices and different levels of fidelity, from apps on phones and PCs to immersive virtual and augmented reality devices. Within the metaverse, you're going to be able to hang out, play games with friends, work, create and more, you're basically going to be able to do everything that you can on the internet today, as well as some things that don't make sense on the internet today, like dancing. The defining quality of the metaverse is presence, which is this feeling that you're really there with another person or in another place. Creation, avatars, and digital objects are going to be central to how we express ourselves, and this is going to lead to entirely new experiences and economic opportunities. I think that overall, this is one of the most exciting projects that we're going to get to work on in our lifetime. But it's going to take a lot of work, and no one company is going to be able to build this all by themselves. Part of what I've learned over the last five years is that we can't just focus on building great experiences. We also need to make sure that we're helping to build ecosystems so millions of other people can participate in the upside and opportunity of what we're all creating. There are going to need to be new protocols and standards, new devices, new chips, new software from rendering engines to payment systems and everything in between. And in order for the metaverse to fill its potential, we believe that it should be built in a way that is open for everyone to participate. I expect that this is going to create a lot of value for many companies up and down the stack, but it's also going to require a very significant investment over many years. I see our focus here as a continuation of our work to build technology that brings people together. In many ways, the metaverse is the ultimate expression of social technology. Some of the experiences that I've dreamed of building since well before I started Facebook are only starting to become possible now. If you look at the investments that we've made over the years, you can see this vision gradually starting to come to focus, and you can see why we're so excited about it. In addition to being the next generation of the Internet, the metaverse is also going to be the next chapter for us as a company. And in the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company. And there's a lot that we need to do to get there, and there are going to be many exciting milestones along the way, including some which we'll share in the months ahead. But in the meantime, I just want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community, all of our partners and employees, And everyone who has supported us so far, I continue to be grateful to be on this journey with all of you. And now, here is Cheryl.",Monologue
"Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to META's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call.

"Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining today. This was a solid quarter for our products and business. It was also an important one for our company. In October, we announced that Meta would be our new name, and we laid out our vision for the Metaverse. And when we shared our plans to connect, I said, this is not something that we're going to do on our own. The metaverse will be built by creators and developers. It will be interoperable. And it will touch many different parts of the economy. In the months since, it's been exciting to see lots of other companies share their own plans for the metaverse and how their experiences and products might show up too. And I look forward to partnering with a lot of them as we work to bring this to life together. Now, last year was about putting a stake in the ground for where we're heading, then this year is going to be about executing. And today, I'm going to discuss our seven major investment priorities for 2022. They are Reels, Community Messaging, Commerce, Ads, Privacy, AI, and of course, the Metaverse. And these are the areas that we're putting a lot more talent and budget towards. But before I get to that, I want to briefly touch on our Q4 results, which I know Cheryl and Dave are going to go deeper on. I'm proud of the work that our teams did here. We shipped products, our community continued to grow, and businesses of all sizes turned to us to help them reach people. But there are two things that I want to call out that are having an impact on our business. The first is competition. People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time, and apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. And this is why our focus on Reels is so important over the long term, as is our work to make sure that our apps are the best services out there for young adults, which I spoke about on our last call. The second area, and related to this, is that we are in the middle of a transition on our own services towards short form video, like Reels. So as more activity shifts towards this medium, we are replacing some time in News Feed and other higher monetizing services So as a result of both competition and the shift to short-form video, as well as our focus on serving young adults over optimizing overall engagement, we're going to continue to see some pressure on impression growth in the near term. Now, I'm confident that leaning harder into these trends is the right short-term tradeoff to make in order to get long-term gains. But we've made these types of transitions before with mobile feed and stories where we took on headwinds in the near term to align with important trends over the long term. And while video has historically been slower to monetize, we believe that over time short form video is going to monetize more like feed or stories than like watch. So I'm optimistic that we'll get to where we need to be with reels too. Ultimately, our continued success relies on building new products that people find valuable and enjoy using. And in a competitive marketplace, we are focused on understanding the areas that we deliver on for people and executing against the strategy. David's going to share more on the impact to our business in a minute, but before we get to that, I want to discuss our investment priorities for 2022. The first one is reels. Now it's clear that short form video will be an increasing part of how people consume content moving forward. And Reels is now our fastest growing content format by far. It's already the biggest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram, and it is growing very quickly on Facebook too. And as we continue to improve the tools for creators, ranking for the people watching, and as we roll out the product everywhere across the world, we expect that this will continue growing quickly. So looking ahead, we're investing in simplifying video across Instagram, building more great creative and monetization tools for creators, and helping more people discover and interact with relevant reels. The next investment priority is community messaging, which is about chatting with groups of people that you have something in common with, whether that's a shared community, an interest, or experience. We already run some of the world's most popular messaging platforms where people connect one-on-one or in groups with friends, family, and colleagues. And we're seeing people increasingly want to share more things and messages that they were previously maybe posted to feed. So I think the popularity that we're seeing with apps like Slack in the workplace or Discord or Telegram reflects this trend too. So we're going to help people on WhatsApp better organize their group chats and make it easier to find information for the communities that they're a part of. like parent groups or neighborhoods. And we're also building community chats on Facebook and Messenger for real-time conversations within those groups and communities. Now, I also want to call out business messaging, since it's an area where there's some real momentum here. We estimate that there are more than one billion users are connecting with a business account across our messaging services every week. And we're partnering with companies like Uber and GeoMart to help people book a ride or have their groceries delivered right from a check. And we're building new tools to make buying online better for people and easier to manage for businesses. And we believe that this can be an important business for us in the years to come. We're also making good progress on our broader commerce efforts. We already help a lot of businesses reach new and existing customers with personalized ads. And our commerce tools are an extension of that. It's a seamless way for people and businesses to buy and sell through our apps. And our strategy here, since introducing shops a year and a half ago, has been to make it as easy as possible for people to make a purchase after discovering a new brand or product without having to switch over to a browser or re-enter their payment info. And Cheryl will share more about our progress here, including some of the success we saw over the holidays. Now, next up is ads. And with Apple's IOS changes and new regulation in Europe, there is a clear trend where less data is available to deliver personalized ads. But people still want to see relevant ads, and businesses still want to reach the right customers. So we're rebuilding a lot of our ads infrastructure so we can continue to grow and deliver high-quality personalized ads. Now, the next two priorities I want to discuss focus on infrastructure that underpins all of our product The first one is privacy. And we've made huge investments in strengthening our approach to privacy, including rebuilding our privacy program and our privacy review process. And we made updates to bring greater privacy to our products, including N10 encrypted backups and disappearing messages on WhatsApp and N10 encrypted voice and video calling on Messenger. And over the next few years, we're focused on building out a major privacy infrastructure project that will encode our privacy commitments at a deeper level of our technical foundation to make them more durable and make product development faster in this evolving environment. Now onto AI. This is one of the areas where we've routinely seen stronger returns on our investments over time than we've expected. Advances in AI enable a lot of the experience that I've talked about so far. It enables us to deliver better ads to people while using less data. that's core to all of our Stacey and security work. It has meaningfully improved the relevance of reels and overall content ranking in general, and it plays a big role in our commerce efforts. Artificial intelligence is also going to play a big role in our work to help build the metaverse. We just announced our AI research supercluster, which we think will be the world's fastest supercomputer once it is complete later this year. And this is going to enable new AI models that can learn from trillions of examples and understand hundreds of languages, which will be key for the kinds of experiences that we're building. Now, looking ahead, we're focused on further scaling our computing power and transforming our AI infrastructure through advances in foundational research, as well as improvements to data center design, networking, storage, and software. Now, the last investment priority here is the metaverse. We are focused on the foundational hardware and software that are required to build an immersive embodied internet that enables better digital social experiences than anything that exists today. On the hardware front, we're seeing real traction with Quest 2. People have spent more than $1 billion on Quest store content, helping virtual reality developers grow and sustain their businesses. We had a strong holiday season, and Oculus reached the top of the App Store for the first time on Christmas Day in the U.S. We're working towards a release of a high-end virtual reality headset later this year, and we continue to make progress developing Project Nazare, which is our first fully augmented reality glasses. That is for software, Horizon. is core to our Metaverse vision. And this is our social VR world building experience that we recently opened to people in the US and Canada. And we've seen a number of talented creators build worlds like a recording studio where producers collaborate or a relaxing space to meditate. And this year we plan to launch a version of Horizon on mobile too. So that'll bring early metaverse experiences to more surfaces beyond VR. So while the deepest and most immersive experiences are going to be in virtual reality, you're also going to be able to access these worlds from your Facebook or Instagram apps as well, and probably more over time. So this will enable us to build even richer social experiences where you can connect with friends in the metaverse, whether they're in VR or not. We're also focused on avatars, which will be how you represent yourself in Horizon and across other developers' experiences in the metaverse. In December, we rolled out our Metaverse Avatars SDK to all Unity developers on Quest and Rift and Windows-based VR platforms, letting developers bring meta avatars to their own VR experiences. We just announced an update that lets you further customize your avatar to better express yourself. And we're introducing digital clothing too, starting with an NFL partnership so you can cheer on your favorite team. You can use your avatar across Quest, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. So it serves as another bridge between our 2D social apps and 3D immersive virtual reality experiences. And we have a bunch of work ahead to make the avatars as expressive and high fidelity as they need to be to fully represent us and help us feel present with one another. But I am very excited for the advances that we're making here. Now, making meaningful progress across all seven of these areas is going to improve the services that we offer today, and it will help power a more social, intuitive, and entertaining metaverse where people, businesses, and creators can all thrive. And this fully realized vision is still a ways off. And although the direction is clear, our path ahead is not yet perfectly defined. But I am pleased with the momentum and the progress that we've made so far. And I am confident that these are the right areas and investments for us to focus on going forward. 2022 is the first page of the next chapter for our company. I'm grateful for all the talented teams at Meta and our partners for executing on this important work. And of course, for all of you who are on this journey with us.",Monologue

"Thanks, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us. The fourth quarter capped off a year where we grew revenue, operating pre-tax income, and operating earnings per share. We stabilized our margin as we moved through the year, and we expanded gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest and take actions to shift our business toward higher value areas like hybrid cloud and AI. including the announcement of our acquisition of Red Hat. And we again generated solid free cash flow, which enables this continued investment and shareholder returns. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $21.8 billion of revenue, which was down 1% of constant currency, though down 3% with the impact of currency translation. As always, I'll focus on constant currency results. Our operating pre-tax income was $5 billion, and we had $4.87 of operating earnings per share. We had strong performance in software, and in services, we had revenue growth and gross margin expansion. This was offset by the expected impact of our IBM Z product cycle dynamics. Our total software revenue was up 2%. We entered the quarter with a good pipeline of software opportunities, and we executed well, driven by hybrid cloud adoption and strong demand for analytics and AI offerings. Total services revenue was up 2%. We had steady improvement in global business services throughout the year, with 6% growth in the fourth quarter, and revenue growth and gross margin expansion across all three of our GBS business lines. Global technology services had a modest revenue decline with solid gross margin expansion. We had a great signings quarter, reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud implementations and our value prop to deliver productivity. Our hardware revenue was down. You'll recall in 2017, we had a terrific fourth quarter in IBM Z, and so our decline reflects a wrap on that performance. This continues to be a very successful Z program and remains ahead of our prior cycle. Once again, we had strong growth in power, with Power9 now introduced throughout our portfolio. As you know, we provide technology and industry expertise to help run our clients' most important processes, which puts us in a unique position to help them transform their businesses. As we exit 2018, we're continuing to see a few themes across our engagements. First, our clients continue to look to turn data into competitive advantage by applying analytics and AI with an industry lens. Second, clients are increasingly looking to cloud to drive business value. As they move more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they need to securely move data and workloads across multiple cloud environments. And that requires a hybrid and open cloud strategy. And third, clients are focused on productivity and predictability in their spend. Now IT has always been about driving both technology innovation and productivity, with the balance shifting over time. We're recently seeing increasing interest in productivity as clients look forward to the next couple of years. And so our results this quarter reflect our ability to deliver innovation and productivity. You see this in our strong results in analytics and AI, in our as-a-service cloud revenue, and in strong signings in our services business that deliver technology solutions and economic value, all through our integrated value proposition. That's why companies such as Vodafone and BMP Parabar are leveraging the IBM Cloud, where they benefit from our hybrid multi-cloud capabilities and access to the most advanced technologies. And it's why Bradesco Bank made a software, hardware, and services multi-year commitment to the IBM Z platform to take them to the next level in AI and hybrid IT, with more predictability in their operating costs. Across our segments, our strategic imperatives revenue for the year was up 9% to about $40 billion. Within that, our cloud revenue is over $19 billion, and we exited the year with an annual run rate for cloud delivered as a service of over $12 billion, which is up 21% over last year. This is a solid base of cloud and cognitive capabilities. and we're continuing to deliver innovation in these high-value areas. For example, in the fourth quarter, we introduced AI OpenScale, a platform to manage the lifecycle of all forms of AI models, and MultiCloud Manager, a service to deploy and manage complete applications in any cloud environment. We're adding innovative services, like the world's first commercial quantum computer available on the IBM Cloud, you may have seen that ExxonMobil is already using it to help address its most complex business challenges, such as energy exploration and chemicals manufacturing. The number of new clients using IBM Cloud Private accelerated in the fourth quarter, and adoption is growing for our IBM Cloud Private for Data platform, which was named a leader in the first quarter 2019 Forrester Wave report on Enterprise Insight platforms. All of this is a validation of our hybrid, open approach to cloud. And we have a strong foundation from which to drive synergies across the business with the addition of Red Hat. Let me pause here to remind you of the value we see from the combination of IBM and Red Hat, which is all about accelerating hybrid cloud adoption. The client response to the announcement has been overwhelmingly positive. They understand the power of this acquisition and the combination of IBM and Red Hat capabilities in helping them move beyond their initial cloud work to really shifting their business applications to the cloud. They are concerned about the secure portability of data and workloads across cloud environments, about consistency and management, and security protocols across clouds, and in avoiding vendor lock-in. They understand how the combination of IBM and Red Hat will help them address these issues. We see the strong bookings Red Hat recently reported as further evidence of clients' confidence in the value. Remember, the quarter ended a month after the transaction was announced. From a value perspective, In addition to the growing Red Hat business itself, we see an opportunity to lift all of IBM by selling more of our own IBM cloud and by selling more of our analytics and AI capabilities on OpenShift across multiple platforms. As clients proceed on their journey to get more business value from the cloud, they need more services help. From the digital design to app modernization, to native app development, to management of hybrid cloud environments. You saw last week the results of Red Hat's shareholder vote with very high participation and over 99% voting in support. We are moving through the regulatory process and continue to expect a close in the second half of 2019. We've had a decade-long partnership with Red Hat and extended it nearly a year ago around hybrid and multi-cloud. And now after the announcement in late October, we've begun the internal enablement planning so we can hit the ground running post-closing. So now I'll go through the details of the fourth quarter, wrap up with a summary of the full year and our view of 2019. As I said, our revenue in a quarter was $21.8 billion. This includes a currency hurt to revenue of over $500 million, which is $150 million more than mid-October spot rates suggested, as the dollar has continued to strengthen. Looking at our margin dynamics, we expanded both our gross and pre-tax operating margins. Our gross margin was up 10 basis points, with strong performance in the services businesses. together up 190 basis points. This was mitigated by the expected mixed headwind from the IBM Z cycle dynamics. Our operating expense was better 5%. When currency impacts the top line, it generally helps expense due to both translation and the benefit of hedging contracts. And so, with the strengthening of the dollar, currency helped our expense by nearly 5 points. Remember, The majority of our hedges are reflected in expense, and these hedging gains mitigate the currency impacts throughout the P&L. We've been focused on driving productivity in our business, implementing new ways of working, like using agile methodologies, and leveraging automation and infusing AI into our processes. This provides flexibility to drive innovation in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, security, and blockchain, while also delivering operating leverage. Within our expense decline, we also had a lower level of IP income. At the beginning of the year, we said we expected IP income to be down year to year, and it has been tracking lower, down $165 million year to year in the fourth quarter, and nearly $450 million for the full year. Putting this expense performance together with our gross margin expansion, pre-tax margin was up 50 basis points. Looking at operating tax, at the beginning of 2018, we provided a range for our full-year tax rate of 16% plus or minus two points, and that was without discrete items. With our final geographic and product mix, the full-year rate without discreets was about 15% within the expected range. Including the discrete items in the first and third quarters, our full-year operating tax rate was 8%, which is a headwind year to year. The resulting tax rate in the fourth quarter was 12%, which is up about six points year to year. Regarding our GAAP tax rate, you saw in our press release that our fourth quarter rate also reflects a charge for a guilty tax election associated with the implementation of 2017 US tax reform. This charge impacts GAAP net income and GAAP earnings per share. And so, turning back to our operating results, operating earnings per share of $4.87 was driven by solid operating leverage offset by expected headwind from tax. Looking at our cash metrics, we generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter with $11.9 billion for the year, in line with our expectations. Our realization of GAAP net income is 111% for the year, normalizing for the non-operating tax reform charge. This supports a high level of investment and shareholder returns. So now let me move on to the segments. Cognitive solutions revenue was up 2%, with 3% growth in solution software and 1% growth in transaction processing software. We expanded pre-tax margin by nearly three points, delivering operating leverage on this revenue growth from both operational efficiencies and mix. while still investing at high levels. In the quarter, we continue to deliver innovation to our clients and scale our platforms and solutions, resulting in growth in our transactional revenue and SaaS signings. In transaction processing software, we capitalize on the strong pipeline of larger transactions we discussed entering the fourth quarter, driven by our clients' buying cycles. Our fourth quarter performance reflects these clients' commitment to our platform for the longer term, given the value we provide in managing their mission critical workloads and predictability in their spending. In solution software, growth was led by analytics and AI offerings, with several other high value areas growing as well. In our underlying analytics platform, We had broad-based growth across our DB2 portfolio, including analytics appliances and data science offerings. Demand for our IBM Cloud Private for Data offering accelerated, and now over 100 clients have adopted the platform. And that's since launching just over six months ago. New clients include the Korea Internet and Security Agency, which is developing an app on ICP for data that leverages a variety of data sources and machine learning models to find and thwart new cyber threats. In addition, we're scaling our newest Watson services running on IBM Cloud Private for Data, like AI OpenScale. In security, we continue to have solid demand for our integrated security and services solutions, including strong growth in our security intelligence and orchestration offerings, Curator and Resilient. Within our industry verticals, Watson Health had growth across payer, provider, imaging, and government. And IoT once again had strong growth in our core offerings, Maximo and Tririga, where we lead the market in asset management and facilities management. In the emerging blockchain area, We announced several new clients this quarter, including our work with Smart Dubai on Middle East's first government-endorsed blockchain platform. We introduced an on-prem offering in November, the IBM Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud Private, and signed several new deals this first month. We see a strong pipeline as clients are interested in the benefits of blockchain behind their firewalls. Now, over the last few quarters, I called out offerings within our solution software, which address horizontal domains, where we face secular shifts in the market, specifically collaboration, commerce, and talent. We've been taking actions, and last month we announced the divestiture of our collaboration and on-prem marketing and commerce products to HCL. After closing, which is currently expected to be mid-year, This action will improve our cognitive solutions revenue performance, normalizing for the divested content, and reflects our commitment to disciplined portfolio management. So now, moving on to services. Before getting into the two segments, I want to provide a view of the total services business. As I said earlier, revenue was up 2%, and gross margin expanded 190 basis points. Looking at our signings on our last earnings call, we talked about the strong pipeline of deals we had going into the fourth quarter, and we executed well, delivering signings of $15.8 billion, which is up 21% at constant currency. This results in a backlog which is now $116 billion. Since it's measured at year-end spot rates, currency is obviously impacting the backlog. But at constant currency, the backlog is down 60 basis points year to year, which is about a two-point improvement versus last quarter's performance. Customers are increasingly looking to leverage digital for growth and innovation, while at the same time increasing efficiencies and reducing costs within their businesses. IBM services can deliver this value by leveraging its breadth across GBS and GTS. A recent example is at the Bank of Philippines Islands, where we'll provide IT infrastructure services as well as digital experience solutions to support the bank's ongoing digital transformation, increasing their IT efficiency and scale and enabling them to seize opportunities in an increasingly digital financial sector. So now turning to global business services, we again delivered solid performance, building on the momentum throughout the year. The GBS team has done a really nice job repositioning this business, and you can see it in the results. Revenue grew 6%, with growth across all business lines, and gross margin expanded 300 basis points. Consulting revenue growth accelerated to 10%. This is validation of our success in bringing together technology and industry expertise to help our clients on their digital journey. We had continued strong growth in digital strategy, fueled by our digital commerce and CRM offerings. We are also accelerating growth in next-generation enterprise applications, led by strong demand in our consulting and implementation services in areas like S4ANA, Salesforce, and Workday. In application management, we grew 4%. This quarter, we returned to growth with strong performance in Cloud Migration Factory and Cloud Application Development, mitigated by continued declines in traditional application management engagements as our clients move to the cloud. The 4% growth also reflects the achievement of significant milestones across a few accounts. We've been also improving our revenue profile in global process services. Revenue grew 5% as we reinvent industry workflows by leveraging automation and infusing AI. And earlier this month, we announced the sale of our Soteris mortgage servicing business. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter and will result in improving revenue and margin profile, normalizing for the divested content. So this action, like the divestiture of select software assets, is about portfolio optimization. We're focusing on higher value offerings that are important to our integrated value proposition. Turning to GBS gross profit, There are a number of drivers of our 300 basis point expansion, including the operating leverage we get on the revenue growth, our mix towards higher value offerings, and capturing the price for value, a help from currency given our global delivery mix, and the yield on our productivity and utilization initiatives, including the realignment of our skills pyramids to key growth areas. In technology services and cloud platforms, we delivered $8.9 billion of revenue, which is flat versus last year. And gross margin expanded approximately 150 basis points. We continue to have strong growth in cloud revenue in this segment, this quarter up 22% year to year. We had a strong signings quarter with 16 transactions over $100 million each. Both new and existing clients are looking to IBM to manage their critical infrastructure and deliver innovation while simultaneously achieving predictable spending. We continue to see momentum in our open hybrid multi-cloud approach. I mentioned BMP Paribas earlier. BMP Paribas has selected IBM to strengthen its cloud environment. With a hybrid multi-cloud approach, bringing together the IBM cloud, private clouds, along with existing infrastructure. Leveraging IBM's technical and industry expertise, BMP Paribas will accelerate its digitization to offer its clients the best services while respecting the security and confidentiality of their data. Looking at the revenue by line of business, infrastructure services revenue was flat. As we prioritize our portfolio, we are exiting some lower value content, which slightly impacts near-term revenue performance, but results in higher margins. In technical support services, revenue was down 3%. TSS continues to be impacted by the hardware product cycle dynamics, partially offset by continued growth in our core multi-vendor services offerings. And finally, integration software growth accelerated to 4%. This performance was driven by continued strong adoption of IBM Cloud Private, where we added 200 new clients. That brings our total number of clients using this innovative platform to 600 in just over a year, as they continue to modernize traditional workloads. We also now have over 100 IBM software offerings integrated with IBM Cloud Private, including Blockchain, Watson, IoT, and Analytics. We are continuing to deliver innovation in this space with new offerings to enable clients in an open, hybrid, multi-cloud world, like IBM Multi-Cloud Manager, which I mentioned earlier. Turning to profit for this segment, gross margin improvement is driven by the lift of our productivity initiatives. This includes infusing AI and automation in our delivery processes, such as by leveraging IBM's services delivery platform with Watson and embedding agile thinking into our service delivery processes. We're also leveraging productivity and talent optimization efforts, where we continue to optimize business processes, reskill our expert workforce, and leverage our global scale. PTI margin was flat. reflecting continued investments to expand our go-to-market capabilities and develop new offerings to capture the hybrid market opportunity. So to wrap up services, at the beginning of 2018, we said we expected an improving trajectory in our services revenue and profit, and we delivered on that throughout the year with a strong fourth quarter. In systems, revenue was down 20% this quarter. I'll remind you that this is compared to a very strong performance in the fourth quarter last year, where we grew 28%. Systems pre-tax margin was down 6.5 points, reflecting the mixed headwind from the IBM Z product cycle. I'll walk through the different dynamics across the hardware portfolio. In IBM Z, we are six quarters into the Z14 cycle. Z revenue declined 44%. while margins expanded modestly, in line with where we are in the cycle. The program continues to track ahead of the prior program, with broad client adoption across industries and countries. We continue to add new clients and new workloads to the platform. Since launching the Z14 program, our MIPS capacity has increased nearly 20%, with new workload MIPS growing twice the rate of our standard MIPS. So, we're taking advantage of the secular shifts in the market, and now over 55% of our installed MIPS inventory is in emerging workload areas. And while there's volatility in the hardware due to product cycles, as we continue to grow our install base up roughly three and a half times over the last decade, This provides stability in our related software, services, and financing business across IBM. Power revenue was up 10%, driven by Linux, and continued strong adoption across our new Power9-based architecture. In the fourth quarter, we completed the release of our next generation Power9 processors in the high end. And we had strong adoption in both the low and high end systems. Our Power9 systems are designed for handling advanced analytics, cloud environments, and data intensive workloads in AI, HANA, and Unix markets. And we now have extended HANA certification to our Power9 high end. In the fourth quarter, we had strong initial traction with our new offerings that optimize both hardware and software for AI, such as PowerAI Vision, which we introduced in the second half of 2018. And we've essentially completed the deployment of our supercomputers at the U.S. Department of Energy labs in the quarter. Storage hardware was down with declines in mid-range mitigated by continued strong growth in all flash arrays. The storage market remains very competitive with ongoing pricing pressures. We're continuing to introduce new innovations and functionality. For example, in December, we extended our next generation NVMe technology into the mid-range with strong initial client adoption. We will continue to roll out NVMe across the storage portfolio in the first half of 2019. So now turning to cash. We generated $7.3 billion of cash from operations in the quarter, excluding our financing receivables. With nearly $900 million in capital expenditures, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter. This capped off a year with $15.6 billion of cash from operations, also excluding financing. We invested $3.7 billion in CapEx this year, mainly in our services and cloud-based businesses, and that's up $400 million from last year. And so we generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion for the year. And as I mentioned, our normalized free cash flow realization was 111%. You'll recall that we expected our free cash flow to be about $12 billion for 2018. The year-to-year decline reflects the headwinds we anticipated from CapEx, working capital, and cash taxes. We returned over $10 billion to shareholders in the year, including dividends of $5.7 billion. We've now increased our dividend per share for 23 consecutive years, and we remain committed to continued dividend increases. We also bought back just under 33 million shares, reducing our average share count by over 2%. At the end of the year, we had $3.3 billion remaining in our buyback authorization. Now looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of $12.2 billion, which without the impact of currency is consistent with a year ago. Total debt was $45.8 billion, down a billion year to year, with 68% in support of our financing business. The leverage in our financing business is in line with the target of 9 to 1, and the credit quality in our financing receivables remains strong at 55% investment grade, a point better than a year ago. And so our balance sheet remains strong, and we are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. As we typically do at the end of the year, I want to provide a quick update on our retirement-related plans. Our U.S. plan has been frozen for over a decade. And over the last several years, we moved our asset base to a lower risk, lower return profile. At the end of 2018, in aggregate, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are nearly fully funded, with the U.S. at 104%, consistent with a year ago. So despite the volatility in the markets, our plans are in really good shape. So let me start to wrap up with some thoughts on 2018, and then I'll move on to expectations for 2019. As we opened the year, we talked about the work we had done to reposition our business, to help move our clients to the future, shifting our portfolio, changing our operating model and the way we work, and reallocating our capital. And in our earnings call last January, we talked about how that drove our expectations for 2018 in revenue, in margin, and in earnings per share. First, we said we expected to grow revenue at then current spot rates. We did, in fact, grow revenue for the year, and that's despite the U.S. dollar appreciation since early 2018, reducing our revenue growth by about 2 points or $1.7 billion. we said we'd stabilize gross margins. While we fell a bit short for the full year, we stabilized gross margin in the third quarter and expanded both gross and pre-tax margin in the fourth quarter and second half. That's for the first time in over three years. We said tax would be a headwind for the year, and it was a headwind to us for the year and in the fourth quarter. We continue to return value to shareholders, with share repurchases contributing to earnings per share growth. And finally, we said we expected operating earnings per share of at least $13.80 and free cash flow of about $12 billion, and we achieved both of these. So looking back on 2018, we grew revenue, operating profit, and operating earnings per share for the year with strong free cash flow realization. We had good momentum in GBS with particular strength in consulting, led by our digital and cloud application offerings. We executed well in software in the fourth quarter, finishing the year strong, led by analytics and AI and our hybrid cloud software. As we execute our strategy to help our clients implement hybrid cloud, our total cloud revenue grew to over $19 billion. Across software and services, We continued to build our as-a-service revenue. We exited the year with a $12 billion annual run rate, which is up 21%. We continued our very successful IBM Z program and strong performance in power with our Power 9 architecture rollout. We repositioned our operating model and drove productivity, which improved our margin profile. We also continue to prioritize our investments and took actions to optimize our portfolio. We announced the sale of select software and services businesses, actions that not only improve our go-forward revenue profile, but allow us to increase our focus and investment in the high-value segments of IT in areas like hybrid cloud, AI, and blockchain. All of this provides a solid business and Financial Foundation for the addition of Red Hat. And it gives us confidence in our expectation for full year 2019 operating earnings per share of at least $13.90. Before we go to Q&A, I want to be clear about what is and is not included in our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, Red Hat is expected to close in the second half. and given the financial implications to 2019 are heavily dependent on the timing of the closing, Red Hat is not included in our expectations. We'll update our view of the year at the time of closing. In the last month and a half, we've also announced two divestitures, the sale of our collaboration and on-prem marketing commerce software, and the sale of our Sateris mortgage servicing business. For these businesses, when we consider the combination of the foregone profit, the gain on the sale of software assets, the actions to address structure and stranded costs, and the resulting benefits from these actions, we expect there to be minimal impact to our profit and earnings per share for the year. And unlike the Red Hat acquisition, the timing of the closing does not have a significant impact on the financial implications for the year, though it may affect the quarterly skew. As a result, our guidance assumes these divestitures. Said another way, because the divestitures are essentially neutral to our profit for 2019, they don't impact operating EPS guidance for the year, though they do have a benefit to our financial profile over the longer term. Turning to free cash flow, we expect about $12 billion in 2019, with a realization rate of about 100%. This reflects our expected operational profit performance and continued working capital efficiency, partially offset with the cash tax headwind. We've also taken into account the estimated free cash flow impacts of the software and services divestitures. Note, that while these are relatively neutral to earnings, they are a headwind to our free cash flow, because the gain proceeds flow into the investing section of our cash flow statement. Finally, while we haven't included Red Hat, we have taken into account an estimate of the pre-closing financing costs associated with the acquisition. So when you put it all together, we see free cash flow of about $12 billion, which is roughly flat year to year, even after absorbing the headwind from the portfolio actions. And with that, let me turn it back to Patricia for the Q&A.",Monologue
"Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have supplemental charts at the end of the slide deck that provide additional information on the quarter and the full year. This includes the 2018 performance, and year-end assumptions for our retirement-related plans, and supporting information on the 2019 implications of our divested businesses. And second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let's please open it up for questions.",Procedure
"Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I want to welcome you to IBM's third quarter 2020 earnings presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Cavanaugh, IBM Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, while we have wrapped on the majority of the impact of the divestitures in 2019, we'll continue to focus on constant currency growth, adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud, and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8K submitted to the SEC. Finally, consistent with our last few quarters, IBM's year-over-year revenue, profit, and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related impacts associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",Procedure
"Thanks, Patricia. I'm pleased to be speaking with you again just a week and a half after our strategic update on October 8th. Today, we'll focus on our third quarter performance, which you'll see is unchanged from the preliminary results we announced. But I want to start with a summary of our strategic discussion. We are redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. Over the last few years, we have built a solid foundation for hybrid cloud. With the acceleration of the Red Hat platform adoption and the changes to clients' needs for application versus infrastructure services, we are separating our managed infrastructure services into a new publicly traded company. The result is two market leaders with focused strategies and missions, and improved growth trajectories ibm is the number one hybrid cloud platform and ai company muco will become the number one managed infrastructure services company as separate businesses each can capitalize on the respective missions both will have more agility to focus on their operating and financial models both will have greater freedom to partner with others and both will align their investment and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. All of this will create value for clients and for you, the investors, with an improved financial profile of both companies. Since the announcement, we have had a comprehensive outreach to our clients. In fact, we have spoken to hundreds of our top clients, and I have personally spoken to dozens. The vast majority understand the strategy and are excited about what it means for them, whether they'll be predominantly future IBM clients or NICO clients. Our partners have also had a positive response, as they see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our go-to-market initiatives in the hybrid cloud, data, and AI spaces. For IBM, as we look forward, the case for hybrid cloud is clear. Clients see two and a half times more value in a hybrid cloud approach versus a public only. It's a tremendous opportunity valued at a trillion dollars with most of the enterprise opportunity ahead of us. Our approach is platform centric. It is differentiated by Red Hat OpenShift, which is our market leading open platform, a vast software portfolio, modernize to run cloud-native, and our GBS expertise that drives platform adoption and meets clients where they are on their cloud journeys. Over the coming months, we'll further advance our strategy by taking actions to simplify and optimize our model, increase investments in key areas, and fostering much more of a growth mindset. All of this will contribute to accelerated growth for our company in the future, and we expect to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth upon completion of the separation of NUCO. Let me shift to some of the recent progress we have made against our hybrid cloud platform strategy from the perspective of our clients, our ecosystem, and the innovations we're bringing to market. We have great recent examples of clients making large-scale architectural commitments to our hybrid cloud platform. Schlumberger is using our platform to make their E&P environment accessible across any infrastructure that their global clients use, on-premise, private, and public clouds. They'll enable the broader energy community to leverage data analytics and AI to unleash the power of digital innovation in the oil and gas industry. We're also extending our relationship with Delta to transform their talent and modernize their IT environment using Red Hat, Cloud Packs, and leveraging GBS's expertise. They'll operate with greater speed and realize longer-term business benefits. We're continuing to expand our ecosystem. Last week, I talked about how we have added hundreds of partners to drive workloads to our platform, including best-of-breed GSIs, and ISVs. As an example, Ernst & Young is now leveraging our open hybrid cloud platform and AI solutions to help clients transform their businesses. Our teams are also providing joint consulting capabilities to drive business outcomes for clients. Late last week, we announced the expansion of our partnership with ServiceNow to bring the power of Watson AIOps to their market-leading now platform. we're also bringing new innovations to market. I'll highlight just two areas, Red Hat and Quantum. Red Hat extended its open hybrid cloud portfolio with several new technology introductions, including OpenShift virtualization, which enables clients to migrate and run their virtual machines natively within Red Hat OpenShift, and advanced cluster management for Kubernetes, which delivers the industry's most robust multi-cluster, policy-based compliance and application management system. These capabilities are furthering our clients' abilities to build once deployed anywhere with a hybrid cloud architecture. In quantum, we announced our roadmap to reach 1,000 plus qubits by 2023. The roadmap aims to take today's noisy, small-scale devices towards the million-plus qubit devices of the future. This kind of progress is essential to help industry and research organizations tackle important real-world problems that even today's most powerful classical computers cannot tackle. And in making our roadmap public, we are committing to meet a series of aggressive benchmarks that will help our company maintain its leadership in quantum computing and place our clients on the path to groundbreaking achievements. So, we've made good progress with clients, our ecosystem, and innovation. Regarding today's environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. In the short term, they are focused on operational stability and cash preservation. We see this especially in our larger software license transactions and delays in some services projects. But more of my conversations with CEOs are around how they become digital businesses. How do they tap into open source innovation? How can they securely deploy and manage their data and applications across various clouds? That's what we call hybrid cloud. We see this in the continued momentum in Red Hat, and the large client engagements that enable a journey to cloud, leveraging both OpenShift and application modernization. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Cavanaugh, who's going to take you through the results, and then we'll come back at the end for Q&A.",Monologue
"Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's second quarter 2021 earnings presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's chairman and chief executive officer, and Jim Cavanaugh, IBM Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we'll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud, and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8K submitted to the SEC. With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",Procedure
"Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be speaking with all of you again. We continue to make progress this quarter. Our revenue growth improved to 3% as reported, led by global business services and our software business. And we grew adjusted free cash flow for the first half. Across every industry, Enterprises are using technology to redesign business processes, whether it's automation in manufacturing, telemedicine in healthcare, or omnichannel in retail. These digital transformations are enabled by a hybrid cloud environment. The technology and services we provide to our clients enable their business growth and productivity increases and improve customer experiences. This is why our strategy is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. At the same time, the overall spend environment continues to improve. With the economy reopening in many parts of the world, many markets and industries are getting back on track. We see this in North America and in select industries. Jim will delve deeper into our performance across the different parts of our business. But I want to be clear up front that with our results over the last two quarters, we remain on track to achieve our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth at actual rates, and $11 to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to take decisive steps and make the investments required to execute on our strategy. This includes making acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio, offering new innovations and digital capabilities to our clients, expanding our portal ecosystem, accelerating changes to our go-to-market model, while also instilling more of a growth mindset among our teams and building a more client-centric culture. We are executing the separation of Kindrel, which is still on track to be completed by the end of the year. The recent announcements within our senior team also support and reinforce our strategic priorities. While there have been a number of changes, our comment on Jim Whitehurst, who has stepped down as president, but remains as a senior advisor to me and the rest of the leadership team. Jim worked on many parts of our strategy, including the integration of Red Hat. Nearly three years since we announced the acquisition, there is no doubt this integration has been successful. Jim remains a strong believer in IBM and our strategy. Given his background, I understand his desire to become an investor. Going back to the execution of our strategy, We are pleased with the early signs of progress from the significant changes we are making. But as you would expect, it will take time before we realize the full benefit of these changes. Our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI is resonating among our clients and bears repeating. Hybrid cloud is more than a strategy. It's the reality for our clients today. They have multiple public clouds, private clouds, on-premise workloads, and are dealing with stringent regulatory and security requirements. Our hybrid cloud platform gives clients the ability to flexibly deploy and manage data and applications across any environment. With hybrid cloud, clients can derive two and a half times more value in comparison to other approaches. Our strategy is platform centric. Linux containers and Kubernetes are at the heart of our hybrid cloud platform. allowing clients to write once, run anywhere. Our software portfolio, including cloud packs built on Red Hat OpenShift, runs cloud native. Our GBS experts work with clients across every industry to accelerate their digital transformation journeys through hybrid cloud and AI. Our systems and industry-specific public clouds provide differentiated infrastructure. This platform approach drives compelling economics to IBM and our ecosystem partners. This quarter, we continue to make progress in the execution of our strategy. More and more clients have chosen our technology and services as a lever for business growth. We now have over 3,200 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. That's almost four times the number of clients just prior to our announcement of the Red Hat acquisition. GBS is helping to drive this platform adoption as we modernize and manage our clients' applications in a hybrid cloud environment. This work is accelerating, and we have now grown to 700 GBS Red Hat-based client engagements since the acquisition. Our hybrid cloud platform is proving to be of immense value across industries. One example is telecommunication companies, which are among the largest technology spenders each year. We recently announced that major Telco clients, including Verizon and Telefonica, have chosen IBM's hybrid cloud platform to transform their core networks and bring to life the era of 5G and edge computing. Moving on to AI, we fundamentally believe that core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to use AI to unlock real-time value from their data wherever the data resides. Our efforts are focused on bringing our AI technologies to horizontal processes. GBS helps our clients build intelligent workflows and transform their core business process, whether that be a supply chain, talent management, or customer service. This allows them to boost productivity and improve the customer experience. An example of this is the work we are doing with CVS Health. As COVID vaccines began rolling out in the United States, IBM built, in just a few weeks, an AI-powered assistant to help CVS Health deal with the massive influx of calls. Watson Health handles more than 10 million calls in three months, improving the customer experience and reducing costs. Keep in mind, this is for one vaccine and one use case. As use cases expand, the benefits will grow. This is a compelling value proposition and we've recently deployed Watson Assistant to other clients ranging from York University to DFW Airport to PayPal. These examples and others reflect our ability to build powerful AI capabilities for business for which we are also externally recognized. IBM was again ranked number one in IDC's artificial intelligence market for 2020 market share. And IBM has been named a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms. Since we announced our new go-to-market model in January, we have made significant changes to our sales model and are providing clients with a more technical and experiential approach. Every client I have spoken to sees the value of this approach. They are pleased to co-innovate with IBM, leverage our garage methodology, and derive value more quickly from our solutions. Of course, we expect the return on these investments, such as improved renewal rates and client expansion, to take time. But time measured in months, not years. We've also been building and expanding a powerful ecosystem of partners who are playing a larger role in helping our clients move along the transformation journey. We're expanding the scope of our partnership with EY. To help financial institutions accelerate digital transformation, IBM and EY recently created the Financial Services Center of Excellence and launched the IBM Tech Hub at EY to strengthen EY's capabilities in hybrid cloud. We also built EY Diligence Edge, an AI platform hosted on the IBM cloud using Watson to drastically decrease the time it takes to do due diligence during mergers and acquisitions. Another partnership that has grown stronger is with Schlumberger. Building on the partnership we announced last year, we've recently launched a new data management platform that clients can leverage to unlock value from the massive amount of data produced by the energy industry. We're seeing growing momentum in our IBM cloud for financial services. Banks have stringent needs driven by compliance, security, and resiliency. Launched last year, The IBM Cloud for Financial Services includes key control and security features built right into its very core. It makes it easier for banks to collaborate with ecosystem partners and vendors. In the second quarter, we reached a milestone of more than 100 ecosystem partners in support of clients like Bank of America and BNP Paribas. While we invest to expand our ecosystem, we are also investing to enhance our portfolio. In the second quarter, we announced a series of products to further differentiate our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. This includes AutoSQL that automates the management of data without having to move it, CodeNet that teaches AI systems on how to translate code, Watson Orchestrate that augments the personal productivity of professionals, CloudEngine to simplify how developers build cloud-native apps, and Mono2Micro to help companies decide which apps should move to the cloud and to transform monolithic apps into microservices. Red Hat launched new managed services on OpenShift, including API management, Apache, Kafka, and data science services that make it easier than ever to build next-generation applications on OpenShift. Meanwhile, we continue to complement our organic investments with acquisitions. Durbanomic is an ARM provider that helps optimize the performance of any application or resources. It builds on the recent acquisition of Instana for APM and observability and the launch of IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps to automate IT operations with AI. We are reinforcing our ecosystem play in GBS with the acquisition of WEG, the leading Salesforce consulting partner in Europe. These are near term opportunities. At the same time, we are focused on emerging and longer term opportunities such as quantum computing. Quantum is an area of incredible promise, slated to unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value for our clients by the end of the decade. To help business and society reap the benefits of quantum computing, we have put a roadmap in place to build a thousand plus qubit computer by 2023. we are forging a series of major partnerships to advance the business and science of quantum computing and post quantum encryption. This quarter we have announced we'll join forces with the University of Tokyo in Japan, the STFC Hartree Center in the United Kingdom and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany. This builds on the partnership we announced last quarter with the Cleveland Clinic. Before I close, I'd like to quickly comment on some of our initiatives around societal issues. This month, we released our 2020 CSR report. In it, you will see our efforts to apply the power of our technologies to advance societal progress, such as applying supercomputing resources in support of COVID-19 research. We have made the important commitment to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 without the use of carbon offsets. We're taking a series of actions to increase our diversity representation, and we are being transparent in our diversity and inclusion scores, as you can see in our report. To close, let me reiterate my confidence in our strategy. Our second quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making towards achieving our two financial objectives, sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth post-separation and strong cash generation.",Monologue
"Welcome and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.",Procedure
"Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's fourth quarter 2021 earnings presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Cavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. I'll remind you the separation of our Managed Infrastructure Services business, Kendrel, was completed on November the 3rd. As a result, our income statement is presented on a continuing operations basis. Our results also reflect the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kendrel. Because this provides a one-time lift to our growth, we will provide the contribution to our revenue growth for the next year. In the spirit of providing additional information to investors, our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8K submitted to the SEC. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.",Procedure
"Good afternoon and welcome to the Netflix Q1 2020 Earnings Interview. I'm Spencer Wong, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO Reed Hastings, CFO Spence Newman, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos, and Chief Product Officer Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Mike Morris from Guggenheim. As a reminder, we'll be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary. With that, let me turn it over to Mike for his first question.",Procedure
"Thank you, Spencer. Good afternoon. Glad to see you all safe and healthy and take this opportunity to extend my best wishes to our viewers. Your letter had a lot of detail about the impact of the environment, but I'd like to hear directly from you some key thoughts and then we can dig in more deeply into a few topics. So we just start with the impact of COVID, the changing consumer behavior. Reid, your thoughts on both the sort of sustained strategic impact of the change and and change of behavior. And then maybe for each of you, if you could highlight the most significant thing that's changed for you and how you're thinking about permanence or how to work through that in the coming weeks and months.",Procedure
"Sure. I don't know if I'm – maybe we'll go to Greg first and then to Ted and just hear your high-level thoughts, please.",Procedure
"Yeah, sure, Kanam. Well, great to see you. Happy New Year, obviously, delayed. So in terms of the guide, first off, we guided to 6 million paid net ads for Q1, if you saw. And obviously, that's still a big number, especially when you think about it in context of 2020, which was by far a record year with 37 million paid net ads. So I know you mentioned the pull forward. I don't think we're declaring that we're necessarily through that yet. So I think there's puts and calls every quarter. But 1, that's still a meaningful factor for us in the guide is thinking through how we kind of grow through that growth from 2020. So there's probably still a little bit of that forward dynamic in the early parts of 2021. And then, you know, more broadly, it's, um, it's just so difficult in this time. I mean, this is 1 of the more uniquely challenging times, not just for life, but. That's most important, but also obviously in terms of trying to just forecast the growth trajectory of the business. There's just so much uncertainty right now. So it's more uncertain than we've ever seen. And we're trying to forecast through that. But at the same time, one thing that's maybe counterbalancing that is that what COVID has done for us is it's accelerated that big shift from linear to streaming entertainment. So the long-term growth trajectory is at least as strong as ever. There's just more short term noise and uncertainty right now, but still very strong underlying growth metrics. And that's what you're seeing in the Q1 guide.",Monologue
"Hey, Nidhi, it's Spence. I guess I'll take this one first. Hopefully you can see us. It looks like it's a little frozen. Maybe it's just frozen on our end. But look, so in terms of Q1 performance, it really boils down to COVID, frankly. As you know, the extraordinary events of COVID have had a big impact on the world, continue to have a big impact on the world. And for us, at a minimum, creates just some short-term kind of choppiness in some of the business trends that we see in our business. So In particular, we had this huge pull forward in 2020 in terms of our subscriber additions, nearly 40 million paid net ads in 2020. And we also had a near global shutdown in production, which we've been ramping safely and at scale through much of last year and into this year. But it did push some key title launches into the back end of this year. So The combination of those two things does create some noise. It's super hard to obviously kind of forecast quarterly subscribers in a typical quarter for us and particularly hard in this environment. In fact, on page two of our earnings letter, we show our actuals relative to forecast, which in our guide is our internal forecast for subscribers. And And, you know, because it's our forecast, we're going to miss every quarter. It's just a matter of whether they're bigger or smaller misses. And we can see over the past five years, our biggest kind of misses to forecast, either up or down, you know, most of those big misses, the biggest were in the past five quarters relative to the past five years, and that was these five quarters of COVID. So it's just a difficult time to forecast the business. But the key is the business remains healthy. Our engagement, our viewing per household was up year over year in Q1. Our churn was down year over year. And the business is still growing. So even at 4 million paid net ads, if you kind of take COVID out and look over the past two years, we've grown from two years ago at about 150 million members to almost 210 million now. So that's nearly 40% growth and about just under 20%. over an average over each of those two years which is in line with the past couple years so the business remains healthy and that's because the long-term driver is this big transition from linear to streaming entertainment and that remains as as healthy as ever but you do see little little um kind of noise in the near term but a lot of long-term clarity thank you that's helpful",Monologue
"Thank you, Spencer. Great to be with you all again this quarter. Lots of exciting stuff to talk about, so let's dive in. Just starting with the quarter, nice to see net ads coming in a little bit better than your expectations. Help us understand what contributed to that.",Procedure
"Sure, Nidhi. I can take that and others can jump in. But as you saw, the quarter kind of played out pretty much as expected. So we delivered 1.5 million paid net ads relative to a guide of a million. And what we're seeing is what we've sort of been talking about for the last couple quarters and that there's still a bit of choppiness to our growth. We had the kind of big pull forward in 2020 of subscriber ads. We also had the push in production of some of our kind of key returning titles and big tentpole new releases until the latter part of the year. But overall, the business is performing well. Our churn is actually down relative to the more comparable two year ago period in 2019, Q2 of 19 before COVID. Our viewing, and we've talked about in the letter, our engagement is up. nearly 20% over that period. But we still feel a little bit of that drag in terms of our acquisition growth as we're kind of working through. What we hope is, and we can't be sure, but what we hope is the tail end of this COVID choppiness where we see on the acquisition side as markets reopen, it does slow things down a little bit.",Monologue
"Sure. I can take that one, Nidhi. Well, so great to see you. And thanks for the kind words in the opening. In terms of what we saw this quarter for Q3, I guess it really boils down to what we saw is sort of what we expected. We talked about in the last call that we hope that we were getting towards that kind of tail end of the COVID choppiness of the pull forward of sub growth into 2020 and those production delays that we're working through as well. And that's kind of what we're seeing. So throughout the quarter, the business remained healthy as it had been throughout the year with churn at low levels down prior to the comparable periods, both in 2020 and two years ago, pre-COVID in 2019. So retention was very healthy and viewing was up. Viewing, remember, maybe slightly down compared to the very COVID distorted 2020 Q3, but up. healthy compared to 2019 comparable period. And then what we saw as the quarter continued into September, we saw acceleration in our growth, which is what we had been hoping for and expecting, but it was good to see as we got into the strength of our schedule. We had a couple big hits. As you know, you mentioned one with Squid Game, La Costa de Papel, the first part of Season 5, but a lot of variety and quality programming throughout the quarter with things like Never Have I Ever and He's All That. Chestnut Man and Copenhagen at the end of the quarter. So just that's basically the way it played out is as we got into the strength of the schedule on top of already kind of healthy business fundamentals, we saw a bit of an uptick in growth.",Monologue
"Great thanks Spencer so your tone in the letter today around competition maturity and macro factors is very different than it was three months ago, I was hoping that you could start out by just walking us through how your views have changed over the past few months.",Procedure
"Yeah, Doug, I mean, I think our views are a little different because our numbers are a little different. If we had made our 2.5 million guidance, I think that was consistent with our thesis and the lower acquisition really forced us to kind of tease apart what's going on. And as we put in the letter, you know, COVID created a lot of noise and how to read the situation, you know, boosted us a lot in 2020. And then in 2021, I think we thoughtfully said it was mostly pull forward, which was the logical conclusion. But now coming into 2022, that doesn't really hold. So then pushing into it, we realized with all of the account sharing, which we've always had, that's not a new thing. But when you add that up together, we're getting pretty high market penetration. And that combined with the competition is really what we think is driving the lower acquisition and lower growth. So on the two parts, we're working on how to monetize sharing. We've been thinking about that for a couple of years, but when we were growing fast, it wasn't the high priority to work on. And now we're working super hard on it. And remember, these are over 100 million households that already are choosing to view Netflix. They love the service. We just got to get paid at some degree for them. So that's part of it. And then two, it's really, we got great competition. They've got some very good shows and films out. And what we got to do is take it up a notch. And I'll tell you that we're all pretty, I know it's disappointing for investors and it is for sure, But internally, we're really geared up and this is like our moment to shine. This is when it all matters. And we're super focused on achieving those objectives and getting back into our investors' good graces.",Monologue
"You know, looking at the quarter, Doug, you know, we're executing really well on the content side, obviously. Ozark, Stranger Things, lots of titles, lots of viewing. We're improving everything we do around marketing, improving the service, the merchandising, and, you know, all of that slowly pays off. If there was a single thing, we might say Stranger Things. But again, we're talking about, you know, losing one million instead of losing two million. So, you know, our excitement is tempered by, you know, the less bad results. But, you know, looking forward, streaming is working everywhere. You know, everyone is pouring in. It's definitely the end of linear TV over the next five, 10 years. So very bullish on streaming. And then our core drivers are just continuing to improve. And then, of course, we'll talk later in the call about monetization and how that's improving. So, you know, tough in some ways losing a million and calling it success. But, you know, really we're set up very well for the next year.",Monologue
"Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2020 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions are Brian Olsoski, our CFO, and Dave Files, Director of Investor Relations. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results, as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, All comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2019. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 30th, 2020 only, and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC. including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, and is highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic. the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now I'll turn the call over to Brian.",Monologue
"Before we move on to the Q&A, I'd like to lead off with a few comments. What we've all seen transpire in the past two months has been gut-wrenching and unprecedented. but it has also been a time of heroic action by healthcare workers, government officials, police and emergency personnel, and all essential workers in our communities. This includes frontline Amazonians, including our Whole Foods team and our partners around the world. They've provided a lifeline of groceries and other critical supplies to the doorsteps of all of us at this critical time. I'd like to give you some insight into what we have seen in Amazon and how we are responding to this crisis. Beginning in early March, we experienced a major surge in customer demand, particularly for household staples and other essential products across categories such as health and personal care, groceries, and even home office supplies. At the same time, we saw lower demand for discretionary items such as apparel, shoes, and wireless products. This large demand spike created major challenges in our operations network and with our seller community and our suppliers. While we generally have experience in getting ready for spikes in demand for known events, like the holiday season and Prime Day, we also generally spend months ramping up for these periods. The COVID crisis allowed for no such preparation. We took quick action to react to the higher order levels while continuing to provide for the safety of our workforce. We established rigorous safety and cleaning protocols, including maintaining six-foot social distancing, procuring 100 million masks, tens of millions of gloves and wipes, and other cleaning supplies. We began requiring temperature checks across our operations network. In our Whole Foods stores, we added plexiglass barriers between cashiers and customers and reserved special hours for senior customers to shop. We temporarily raised wages and overtime premiums. We funded a new Amazon relief fund, and we allowed employees to take unpaid time off at their discretion. To deal with the unprecedented demand, we hired an additional 175,000 new employees, many of whom were displaced from other jobs in the economy. We took steps to dampen demand for non-essential products, including reducing our marketing spend. Our network pivoted to shipping priority products within one to four days and extending promises on non-priority items. Our independent third-party sellers, most of whom are small and medium-sized businesses, work tremendously hard to serve our customers, and we are grateful for their efforts. Third-party sellers continue to see strong growth in our stores, as more than half our units sold are from third-party sellers. We increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 60%, and expanded in-store pickup at Whole Foods stores from 80 stores to more than 150 stores. and other Amazon teams shifted their focus to directly helping customers in the overall effort to fight the COVID virus. AWS has created Data Lake to assist healthcare workers, researchers, scientists, and public health officials who are working to understand and fight the coronavirus. Many of our AWS products are helping in the government response to the crisis and are there for customers who are seeing their own demand spikes. companies enabling video conferencing, remote learning, and online health services, for example. Amazon Flex is supporting food banks by donating delivery services of groceries to serve 6 million meals in Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., with plans to ramp this up to 25 cities across the U.S. And Alexa is helping customers access important CDC guidance. and help them evaluate their own COVID-19 risk levels. How is all this impacting our business? While customer demand remains high, the incremental revenue we are seeing on many of the lower ASP essential products is basically coming at cost. We've invested more than $600 million in COVID-related costs in Q1 and expect these costs could grow to $4 billion or more in Q2. These include productivity headwinds in our facilities as we provide for social distancing, and allow for the ramp-up of new employees, investments in personal protective equipment for employees, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, higher wages for our hourly teams, and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop COVID-19 testing capabilities. In Q1, we also had another $400 million of costs related to increased reserves for doubtful accounts. On the flip side, we did see a drop in travel, entertainment, and meeting costs, as well as lower marketing as a way to dampen our demand for non-essential items. While we can't have great certainty about what the next few quarters will look like, I'm humbled by the efforts of my fellow Amazonians in delivering essential goods and services to so many people. We take this responsibility seriously, and we're proud of the work our teams are doing to help customers through this difficult time. With that, let's open up for questions.",Monologue

"Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen today and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce and cloud services, and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. This guidance also reflects our estimates to date regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC. And it's highly dependent on numerous factors that we may not be able to predict or control, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any recurrence, actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on global and regional economies and economic activity, workforce staffing and productivity, and our significant and continuing spending on employee safety measures, our ability to continue operations in affected areas, and consumer demand and spending patterns, as well as the effects on suppliers, creditors, and third-party sellers, all of which are uncertain. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brian.",Monologue
"Thank you for joining today's call. I'd like to start with a few comments on what we're seeing as we're coming out of the pandemic, both on the customer experience side and on the operating cost side in this current inflationary environment. Let's start with demand and customer experience. Worldwide net sales in Q1 were $116.4 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This is the top end of our guidance range of $112 billion to $117 billion. Our compound annual growth since before the pandemic stands at 25%, a growth rate higher than what we were seeing before the pandemic. Our Prime members continue to be a key driver of growth. Prime members have meaningfully increased their spend since the start of the pandemic, and we continue to see consistently high member renewal rates. We also added millions more new Prime members during the quarter. Throughout the past two years, we've seen stronger usage of Prime benefits by Prime members and a greater reliance on Amazon for their shopping and entertainment. In the first quarter, we made encouraging progress on key customer metrics. Delivery speed performance is now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020. And we now have the widest selection ever available for Prime's fast delivery. We have worked to protect and enhance the customer experience despite a sharp increase in costs, particularly over the past three quarters. We've seen a large cost to keep up with demand these past two years. During this period, we doubled the size of our operations and nearly doubled our workforce to 1.6 million employees. Labor and physical space are no longer the bottlenecks they were throughout much of 2020 and 2021. However, we continue to face a variety of cost pressures in our consumer business. We'll break these into two buckets, externally driven costs, primarily inflation, and internally controllable costs, primarily productivity and fixed cost deleverage. The externally driven costs are a result of intensifying inflationary pressures throughout Q1. Line haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year, which are already much higher than pre-COVID levels. Some of this is due to the impact of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages at point of origin. And the start of the war in the Ukraine has contributed to high fuel prices. For example, the cost to ship in overseas containers more than doubled compared to pre-pandemic rates. The cost of fuel is approximately one and a half times higher than it was even a year ago. Combined with the year-over-year increases in wage inflation, these inflationary pressures have added approximately $2 billion of incremental costs when compared to last year. While we will continue to look for ways to mitigate these costs, we expect they will be around for some time. The next bucket of costs relate to productivity and fixed cost leverage, which we consider to be more within our control and are working to reduce. These additional costs correspond to the state of the labor force and fulfillment network. following two years of disruption and large demand variability. We now look forward to more predictability in our consumer order patterns and greater stability in our operations. Let's start with labor. As a reminder, in the second half of 2021, we were operating in a labor-constrained environment. With the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, we saw a substantial increase in fulfillment network employees out on leave, and we continue to hire new employees to cover these absences. As the variance subsided in the second half of the quarter and employees returned from leave, we quickly transitioned from being understaffed to being overstaffed, resulting in lower productivity. This lower productivity added approximately $2 billion in cost compared to last year. In the last few weeks of the quarter and into April, we've seen productivity improvements across the network, and we expect to reduce these cost headwinds in Q2. The last issue relates to our fixed cost leverage. Despite still seeing strong customer demand and expansion of our FBA business, we currently have excess capacity in our fulfillment and transportation network. Capacity decisions are made years in advance, and we made conscious decisions in 2020 and early 2021 to not let space be a constraint on our business. During the pandemic, we were facing not only unprecedented demand, but also extended lead times on new capacity. And we built towards the high end of a very volatile demand outlook. Now that demand patterns have stabilized, we see an opportunity to better match our capacity to demand. We have lowered our operations capital expenditures for 2022 and are evaluating other ways to increase our fixed cost leverage. We estimate that this overcapacity, coupled with the extraordinary leverage we saw in Q1 of last year, resulted in $2 billion of additional costs year-over-year in Q1. We do expect the effects of these fixed cost leverage to persist for the next several quarters as we grow into this capacity. When you combine the impacts of the externally driven costs and the internally controllable costs, you get approximately $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter. Approximately two-thirds of these costs are within our control, and with demand normalizing, we remain focused on right-sizing our cost structure and driving out any cost inefficiencies. Our guidance includes an expectation that we will incur approximately $4 billion of these incremental costs in Q2. We saw another strong quarter of innovation and customer engagement in the AWS segment, where net sales were $18.4 billion in Q1, up 37% year-over-year, and now represent an annualized sales run rate of nearly $74 billion. Developers at organizations of all sizes, from governments and not-for-profits to startups and enterprises, continue to choose Amazon Web Services. Companies like Telefonica, Verizon, Boeing, MongoDB, Amdocs, Bundesliga, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the NHL, and Thread announced new agreements and service launches supported by AWS. We also continue to build support infrastructure to best serve AWS's millions of customers. We recently completed the launch of our first 16 local zones in the United States, with 32 more to come across 26 countries. Local zones extend AWS regions to place our services at the edge of the cloud near large population, industry, and IT centers, expanding our infrastructure footprint and enabling customers to build with single-digit millisecond latency performance. Last quarter, I provided some detail on our overall capital investments, so let me add to that with our current thinking. First, as a reminder, we look at the combination of CapEx plus finance leases. Capital investments were $61 billion on the trailing 12-month period ended March 31st. About 40% of that went to infrastructure, primarily supporting AWS, but also supporting our sizable consumer business. About 30% is fulfillment capacity, primarily fulfillment center warehouses. A little less than 25% is for transportation. So think of that as the middle and last mile capacity related to customer shipments. The remaining 5% or so is comprised of things like corporate space and physical stores. For full year 2022, we do expect infrastructure spend to grow year over year, in large part to support the rapid growth and innovation we're seeing within AWS. We expect infrastructure should represent about half of our total capital investments in 2022. For the consumer business, as I said earlier, we currently have some excess capacity in the network that we need to grow into, so we've brought down our build expectations And note again that many of the bill decisions were made 18 to 24 months ago, so there are limitations on what we can adjust mid-year. That said, we expect fulfillment dollars spent on capital projects to be lower in 2022 versus the prior year. We also expect transportation dollars spent on capital projects to be flat to slightly down. Finally, I'll highlight a few additional items. We reported an overall net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter. While we primarily focus our comments on operating income, I'd point out that this net loss includes a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion included in non-operating expense from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive. You may remember that we had a $12 billion gain on Rivian in Q4. We also provided our second quarter financial guidance as part of our earnings release. As a reminder, our comparable period of Q2 2021 included continuation extraordinary net sales growth through roughly the first half of that quarter. That began to moderate in the second half as vaccines became more readily available in many countries and people started getting out of their homes. In addition, note that this year's Prime Day sales event will occur in the third quarter, in July to be specific. Last year in 2021, Prime Day occurred in the second quarter. Prime Day contributed about 400 basis points to our Q2 2021 year-over-year revenue growth rate. Lastly, as you look at our Q2 operating income guidance, a reminder that we will see our seasonal step up in stock-based compensation expense as our employees receive annual restricted stock unit grants in the second quarter. This year we expect to see stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6 billion, up from $3.3 billion in Q1, largely reflecting wage inflation as we continue to hire and retain employees in high demand areas, including engineers and other tech workers. With that, let's move on to your questions.",Monologue
"Thanks, Dave. Today we're reporting $158.9 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 billion, up 56% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $46.1 billion, up 128% or $25.9 billion year-over-year. As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long-term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business that outlasts all of us. In our stores business, we saw sales growth of 9% year-over-year in the North America segment and 12% year-over-year in the international segment. Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers. Really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month, and fuel savings of 10 cents a gallon at BP, Amoco, and AMPM stations in the U.S. At a time when consumers are being careful about how much they spend, We're continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly, and we can see this resonating with customers as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth. In the last few months, we've hosted our largest and most successful Prime Day and Prime Big Deal Days ever and helped customers save over $5 billion across more than 50 million deals. And for the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve. and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area. First, we continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we've captured thus far in outbound regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we're in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to our regional fulfillment nodes. In the last few months, we've made hundreds of changes to our U.S. inbound network and opened more than 15 inbound buildings. While it's still relatively early in this re-architecture, we've already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year over year. allowing us to have more of the requisite items in fulfillment centers closest to the customer so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly. As we scale and optimize this new design, we expect these changes will further improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery time, save transportation costs, and enable us to increase units shipped per box. Second, we continue to roll out same-day delivery facilities, which is not only the fastest way to get products to customers, but also one of our lowest-cost ways to deliver. Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, an increase of more than 25% year-over-year. And third, we continue to innovate in robotics to speed delivery, lower costs to serve, and further improve safety in our fulfillment networks. We recently launched our 12th generation fulfillment center design for the first building launching in Shreveport, Louisiana. This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that simplify stowing, picking, packing, and shipping processes. Thus far, this new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery, and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next-generation facility. Though we believe we have more expansive automation and robotics than other retail peers, it's still early days in how much automation we expect in our fulfillment network. In advertising, we remain pleased with our progress, generating $14.3 billion of revenue in the quarter, 18.8% year-over-year growth. Our expansive reach, ability to surface relevant offers to our customers, opportunity to engage customers from the top of the funnel to point of purchase, and leading capabilities around measuring outcomes at every touchpoint provide all types of brands with full funnel advertising at scale. With sponsored products, we're seeing meaningful growth on a very large base, and we see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers by further improving the relevancy of the ads we show and by providing additional optimization controls. At the same time, some of our newer offerings are in their very early days. We're just entering our first broadcast season for prime video advertising, following a very strong showing at upfronts. and we're continuing to support brands of all sizes with our generative AI-powered creative tools across display, video, and audio, including our video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. While we're generating a lot of advertising revenue today, there remains considerable upside. AWS grew 19.1% year over year, and now stands at a $110 billion annualized run rate. We've seen significant re-acceleration of AWS growth for the last four quarters. With the broadest functionality, the strongest security and operational performance, and the deepest partner community, AWS continues to be customers' partner of choice. There are signs of this in every part of AWS's business. We see more enterprises growing their footprint in the cloud, evidenced in part by recent customer deals with the ANZ Banking Group, Booking.com, Capital One, Fast Retailing, Itaú, Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Sony, T-Mobile, and Toyota. You can look at our partnership with NVIDIA called Project SEBA. where NVIDIA has chosen AWS's infrastructure for its R&D supercomputer due in part to AWS's leading operational performance and security. And you can see how AWS continues to innovate in its infrastructure capabilities with deliveries like Aurora Limited Database, which extends AWS's very successful relational database to support millions of database writes per second and manage petabytes of data while maintaining the simplicity of operating a single database. or with our custom Graviton4 CPU instances, which provide up to nearly 40% better price performance versus other leading x86 processors. Companies are focused on new efforts again, spending energy on modernizing their infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. This modernization enables companies to save money, innovate more quickly, and get more productivity from their scarce engineering resources. However, it also allows them to organize their data in the right architecture and environment to do generative AI at scale. It's much harder to be successful and competitive in generative AI if your data is not in the cloud. The AWS team continues to make rapid progress in delivering AI capabilities for customers and building a substantial AI business. In the last 18 months, AWS has released nearly twice as many machine learning and gen AI features as the other leading cloud providers combined. AWS's AI business is a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple digit year over year percentage and is growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution as AWS itself grew. We felt like AWS grew pretty quickly. We talk about our AI offering as three macro layers of the stack. with each layer being a giant opportunity, and each is progressing rapidly. At the bottom layer, which is for model builders, we were the first major cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's H200 GPUs through our EC2 P5e instances. And thanks to our networking innovations like Elastic Fabric Adapter and Nitro, we continue to offer advantaged networking performance. And while we have a deep partnership with NVIDIA, we've also heard from customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Tranium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Tranium, Tranium 2, is starting to ramp up the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance. We're seeing significant interest in these chips, and we've gone back to our manufacturing partners multiple times to produce much more than we'd originally planned. We also continue to see increasingly more model builders standardize an Amazon SageMaker, a service that makes it much easier to manage your AI data, build models, experiment, and deploy to production. This team continues to add features at a rapid clip, punctuated by SageMaker's unique HyperPod capability, which automatically splits training workloads across more than 1,000 AI accelerators, prevents interruptions by periodically saving checkpoints and automatically repairing faulty instances from their last saved checkpoint, and saving training time by up to 40%. At the middle layer, where teams want to leverage an existing foundation model, customize with their data, and then have features to deploy high-quality generative AI applications, Amazon Bedrock has the broadest selection of leading foundation models and most compelling modules for key capabilities like model evaluation, guardrails, RAG, and agents. Recently, we've added Anthropics Club 3.5 Sonnet model, Meta's Llama 3.2 models, Mistral's large two models and multiple stability AI models. We also continue to see teams use multiple model types from different model providers and multiple model sizes in the same application. There's muck and orchestration required to make this happen, and part of what makes Bedrock so appealing to customers and why it has so much traction is that Bedrock makes this much easier. Customers have many other requests, access to even more models, making prompt management easier, further optimizing inference costs, and our Bedrock team is hard at work making this happen. At the application or top layer, we're continuing to see strong adoption of Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development and to leverage your own data. Q has the highest reported code acceptance rates in the industry for multi-line code suggestions. The team has added all sorts of capabilities in the last few months, but the very practical use case recently shared, where Q-Transform saved Amazon's teams $260 million and 4,500 developer years in migrating over 30,000 applications to new versions of the Java JDK, has excited developers and prompted them to ask how else we could help them with tedious and painful transformations. Spend a few minutes reading developer forums about what they wish they could move away from, and you'll get an idea of what they want. Expect more practical AI game changers from Q. We're also using generative AI pervasively across Amazon's other businesses, with hundreds of apps in development or launch. For consumers, we've expanded Rufus, our generative AI-powered expert shopping assistant, to the UK, India, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Canada. And in the US, we've added more personalization, the ability to better narrow customer intent, and real-time pricing and deal information. We've recently debuted AI Shopping Guides for consumers, which simplifies product research by using generative AI to pair key factors to consider in a product category with Amazon's wide selection, making it easier for customers to find the right product for their needs. For sellers, we've recently launched Project Amelia, an AI assistant that offers tailored business insights to boost productivity and drive seller growth. We continue to re-architect the brain of Alexa with a new set of foundation models that we'll share with customers in the near future, and we're increasingly adding more AI into all of our devices. Take the new Kindle Scribe we just announced. The note-taking experience is much more powerful with the new built-in AI-powered notebook, which enables you to quickly summarize pages of notes into concise bullets in a script font that can easily be shared. Speaking of Kindle products, We just launched a completely new Kindle lineup, the first time we've done a portfolio refresh of this size. Apart from the scribe, it includes the first-ever color Kindle, the fastest Kindle Paperwhite ever, and a new pocket-sized Kindle. The early sales for these devices have significantly outperformed our expectations, and Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever. We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide. There are so many things we're energized by right now, but we'll quickly mention one more, the progress we're making in improving customers' pharmacy experience. Brick-and-mortar pharmacies account for just over 90% of prescriptions dispensed in the U.S., but require customers make trips to foreign physical venues with much of the selection behind locked shelves, waiting lines for meds, and only find out about pricing at the point of purchase. The largest mail order pharmacies offer deliver in five to 10 business days. We think customers deserve better. Today, we can deliver to 95% of first-time Amazon Pharmacy customers in the U.S. within two business days and to 20% of U.S. Prime members within 24 hours. Next year, we plan to launch operations in 20 new cities, so nearly half the U.S. will have the ability to have their medications delivered to their door within hours. We believe making it easier for customers to get their medications will improve medication adherence, which we know can directly improve health outcomes. Across Amazon, we have a lot coming in the next few months. We eagerly look forward to sharing these with customers, and a big thank you to my Amazon teammates around the world for all their hard work. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian for a financial update. Thanks, Andy.",Monologue
"Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam, and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds, and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras, and the intuitive dynamic island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone 15 Pro lineup has a beautiful, strong, and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family, and reviews have been off the charts. In MAC, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple Silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace, and our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad, revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets, and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life while giving students a window into the world around them. And in artist workshops, design studios, and everywhere else creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas further than they ever could before. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives, and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first ever carbon neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination. Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new FaceTime features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in Mac OS Sonoma and iPad OS 17, or a bold new look in Watch OS X that lets you see and do more faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Advertising, Apple Care, iCloud, Payment Services, and Video, as well as a September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness Plus, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV Plus continues to delight customers as well. With new and returning shows like The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, and Monarch, we're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+, and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch just over four years ago, Apple TV+, has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins. We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home the MLS Cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China, and the UK, and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day, and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with a customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories to life-saving features like emergency SOS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise. The best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it, and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon neutral products represent a major milestone, and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy. Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense of possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",Monologue
