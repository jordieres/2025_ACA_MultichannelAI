So, you know, with our think and act like an owner, highly decentralized structure, we like the idea that every one of our operating units is the ones that sit and have to negotiate the contract. They're the ones who have to live with them. There's really only a couple that are kind of larger, more corporate driven. So we've obviously referred to Boeing in the past. Other than that, I mean, these are really contracts, OEM contracts that are negotiated operating unit by operating unit.",2925.168,2957.423,Answer,pair_19,TDG,2024,Q3,Business

When we look at the momentum in the business, it just continues, you know, the way we had imagined. The way you have to think about it is you're right. I mean, if you look at the sort of 60 million above the, you know, guide that we had done, you also have to factor in that there was actually foreign exchange that was probably a little bit more of a, you know, headwind. So, we actually had a very strong quarter. What happens in some of the accounts is you're recognizing the revenue upfront rather than recognizing them rattably. And so, that's part of the reason for, you know, how you should think about what might that also play out in Q2 for the same reason, namely deferred revenue. But, you know, in terms of how we looked at the targets for 606 for fiscal 19, we wanted to give you an update. It's early in the year, you know, the business is doing well on the ARR front, you know, which has nothing to do with 606 or 605. You know, moving forward, we were very clear about the success that we're continuing to have. And so, that's part of the way we're doing it. But we're excited about the business.",2994.94,3066.02,Answer,pair_12,ADBE,2019,Q1,MD&A

So I guess, you know, just very broadly speaking, you know, now that, you know, we have kind of timeline on yogurt divestment, would you say you're kind of like largely done with that divestment piece of the portfolio optimization efforts? Or, you know, are you always looking, let's say, you know, and specifically looking at certain pockets that, you know, could still be up for divestment potential? And that's it.

I was just wondering if you can... not to beat a dead horse on 23 guidance which I know I'm doing but just what the exposure is at this point on the E&P side and then also as you think about hedging 24 for on the E&P side which what you're thinking and maybe in light of also potentially doing some some transactions around E&P with the gasp curve having creeped up a little bit here",3091.68,3120.4,Question,pair_17,WMB,2023,Q2,Risk Factors
4,spk13,James Quincy,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,"Sure. So, yeah. Clearly, by saying we're expecting a balance between volume and price, in our overall rare immune guidelines, there is an implicit volume growth. That is are broad-based geographically. Obviously, more tends to be faster, rather tends to be in the emerging markets and slower in the developed markets. Yes, it is predicated on improvements in a way from home, particularly in those countries which are not yet back to 2019 levels. You know, whilst we have emerged stronger and our total business is bigger than it was in 2019, whether that be volume, revenue, or profits, That is not true in every country. And so, you know, and actually in total, away from home is not back to where it was in 2019. So there's clearly more left to come back, which is why, you know, effectively, implicitly, there's a little more volume in the 2022 guidance than in the normal long-term algorithm. And similarly, with price mix, as I commented earlier, it's going to be, you know, implicitly a little more than usual. And I think you'll have to kind of look at, I would encourage everyone to look at some of the two-year stacked rates in terms of volume and price, to look at how it's been moving by group and by business segment as you think about your modeling going into 2020.",2340.149,2429.3410000000003,Answer,pair_6,KO,2021,Q4,MD&A
5,spk06,,,"pharmaceutical, we saw stability in the distribution fundamentals reflected in solid growth and adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2022. Our ability to drive sustainable growth in this business derives from a few factors. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in the core distribution assets, expanding and strengthening our capabilities and unlocking new efficiencies in the business. On the generics and branded front, the fundamentals of the pricing environment remain stable and and generally track in line with our expectations. Our balanced approach of managing a broad portfolio of pharmaceutical products allows us to strengthen our competitive position and enables us to be resilient and flexible to market movements. We remain focused on the investment and expansion of our oncology ecosystem. We're pleased with the growth momentum across our oncology assets, from provider solutions and the U.S. Oncology Network to our data and our insights business, Ontata. They're critical pieces to the long-term growth of this segment, and we're excited to capture the market opportunity and further our progress in fiscal 2023. In prescription technology solutions, we saw another year of adjusted operating profit growth driven by expansion of our product offerings as we bring more brands onto the platform and increased transaction volume as the market recovered. A good example of growth in this segment is our Access for More Patients, or AMP, solutions. which was developed and launched about three years ago. The solutions focused on automating benefit verification and hub enrollments for patients. And in fiscal 2022, we saw accelerated growth with 25% increase in the number of brands on the program. It has contributed to the overall growth across the enterprise and more importantly, help patients get on therapies up to eight days faster and stay on therapies longer, driving better health outcomes. We anticipate innovations like this will continue to fuel growth and strengthen our differentiated product offerings. Our future innovations and investments will be centered around expanding the reach of our current products into adjacent markets, such as specialty brands and medical benefits. We continue to invest into the future growth of this segment. Moving on to medical surgical, which has performed exceedingly well this past year. Excluding the benefit from COVID-19 items, the underlying medical-surgical distribution business grew at a double-digit rate for adjusted operating profit. The lab business that we highlighted before is just one of the drivers for this outstanding growth trajectory. Recovery in the primary care market and our expansion of selling prescription drugs into the non-acute channel also contributed to the segment. Looking ahead, as a leader in the alternate site market, we believe that this segment is well positioned as more site of care moves into the communities. Our experience and our relationships in every channel and setting of the alternate site markets enable us to capture this growth opportunity in the years ahead. In the international segment, our strategy and commitment to the Canadian operations remains unchanged. McKesson Canada is a leader in pharmaceutical distribution in the country and has a portfolio of valuable assets, including the retail banner groups, Rexall, specialty pharmacies, and digital offerings such as Well.ca. We will continue to build and grow this business. In summary, we're extremely pleased with the progress we've made in fiscal 2022 to further our transformation into a diversified healthcare services company. Looking ahead to our fiscal 2023, our guidance of $22.90 to $23.60 of adjusted earnings per diluted share includes organic growth of the underlying businesses, improved operating leverage, and a balanced approach to capital deployment. Excluding the contribution from COVID-19 related items in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, and net gains from McKesson Ventures in fiscal 2022, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to grow 9% to 14% year over year. We expect the adjusted operating profit growth in our U.S. pharmaceutical, prescription technology, and medical surgical segments to be in line or above the long-term financial framework we laid out at our investor day last December. We anticipate the market to remain dynamic, particularly as it relates to supply chain and inflation. We're confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to minimize any potential impacts. Our fiscal 2023 guidance does not assume a material headwind from supply chain disruption or sustained price inflation. Britt will walk you through the additional details that we've included in the outlook. As we look ahead to fiscal 2023, we're excited and energized to build on the momentum and to capitalize on our strong market position. We're advancing our transformation to a diversified healthcare services company, extending our long tradition of innovation and evolving our business. while reaffirming our strong commitment to addressing the changing needs of our customers, their patients, and the broader healthcare industry. Our success in building differentiated assets and capabilities positions us well to support better health outcomes and to accelerate profitability and healthy growth for the company. I want to conclude my remarks by acknowledging our employees who are dedicated to bringing insight, products, and services to our customers and partners. Thanks to their execution and their commitment to McKesson and to each other, we're improving care in every setting, one product, one partner, and one patient at a time. We are truly enabling better health for all. Thank you for your time this afternoon, and now I'm going to hand it over to Britt.",889.632,1237.396,Answer,pair_1,MCK,2022,Q4,MD&A

So, Rick, you showed this slide, you know, talking about gross margin performance over time and recognizing you're expecting to have a nice bounce back here in 23. You're still kind of, you know, 200 basis points or so below, you know, kind of the 2019-2020 gross margins. And, you know, I don't want to sit here and ask a question for 2024 guidance in February of 2023, but... You spoke to multi-years of opportunity of gross margin expansion. So I guess how big of a priority is that in terms of getting back to that level over time? And as you think about the cadence of the year and kind of look forward here, how quickly can you get back to 45% gross margin?",4917.645,4961.464,Question,pair_17,CHD,2022,Q4,MD&A

8,spk04,,,"Yeah, maybe. Hey, David, it's Bob, and good morning, and thanks for the question. When I think about my prepared remarks, I made the comment around 15,000 megawatts of generation by the end of the decade. If you think seven of that's in Colorado, then the balance, eight to 13, is a combination of SPS and NSP. There's very little in our capital plan, our seal for fuel plan, that's included for those two regions in our capital plan or in our seal for fuel 2.0 that Brian laid out. So we have real generation upside investment opportunities. They're a little longer dated, so I think 28 to 30 may be outside of the plan period. Some might creep into this five years, but I think it's really more backdated. But that's a substantial amount of generation in each of those two jurisdictions. We did go through a resource plan in Minnesota, the 1,200 megawatts that we referenced in terms of RFP, for next year is part of that program. But this probably 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts of that is in the upper Midwest, largely approved as part of our last resource plan that we need to go execute upon.",2739.231,2819.205,Answer,pair_12,XEL,2023,Q3,Business

Within skin health and beauty and essential health, the growth in both segments came in slightly below external forecast. So I was hoping you could put a bit more definition around that. how they compared to your internal forecast. And you've spoken to the Asia issues and essential health, but just more broadly. And then I was also hoping you could just clarify for us exactly when you expect to fully cycle the portfolio rationalization headwinds that are impacting both those segments. And if possible, just within the context of that five and a half to six and a half percent organic growth call for the year, Talk a bit about how you expect the three segments to contribute to that on an annual basis to give us a little bit more perspective on how the second half is likely to shake out.",3117.156,3179.2,Question,pair_12,KVUE,2023,Q2,MD&A

We continue to execute on that, as you heard from Michael, in terms of some of the wins which we had recently. Obviously, you get the benefit of improving cross-border trends to play through in terms of newer amounts of rebates and incentives, impacting that. And the last point I'll make on rebates and incentives is in Q1, we had this one-time benefit relating to the non-renewal of our Russian customer agreement, which you should not expect the benefit of that to come through on a going forward basis. So net-net, I would tell you that, you know, a lot of this is going to be, you know, dependent on what the timing of deals are, how we put the new and renewed deals into play, and what the recovery of transport is going to be.",3614.148,3658.554,Answer,pair_14,MA,2022,Q1,MD&A

I mean, we don't speak about gross margin, but just to give you a context, Lauren, year over year, we did have a meaningful gain in gross margins on the segment, over 200 basis points. We, you know, on a quarter over quarter, you're always going to see a few puts and takes depending on mix and elements that flow through. But net-net, I mean, we are seeing an upward trend. So I wouldn't get too hung up on the overall movement quarter to quarter for the segment because, you know, overall we are seeing an upward trend and recovery on the margins.",1012.6,1052.812,Answer,pair_1,KMB,2023,Q2,MD&A

However, we will be beginning the Nintendo Switch back up and that does have lower gross margins than the company average, influencing therefore Q2 gross margin guidance that we have provided.

15,spk08,Elon Musk,CEO,"Well, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's always important to separate out affordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or a given product is too expensive, and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buy it, no matter what their value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to such that people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability. And so we have to improve the affordability of our products so they are not out of reach of people. We want to bring them more in reach over time, but also improve our cost of production, We get hopefully a little bit better every year, sometimes a lot better.

19,spk23,Tim Cook,Chief Executive Officer,"Yeah, China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year over year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone Keep in mind that 5G in China is that the network is well established and the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so, I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so, iPhone did extremely well. However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the company average. Mac was above the company average. Wearables, home and accessories was above the company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there. In terms of COVID, I think they're, at least for last quarter, they were sort of beyond COVID and very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring, but we have not seen that in our businesses yet.

And so to the extent that we can do better offsetting that, don't have an inflation number for next year yet, certainly going to be impacted by the higher wages. This year's inflation, while we came into the year thinking inflation was probably going to be around 3%, and that'd be higher than what we've seen historically, it's probably going to be closer to 5%. And it's accelerated, obviously, as we've gotten here in the back half of the year and had some of these wage settlements.

I mean, that's nice de-levering after what had been some of the largest M&A that the company's ever done. To your point on future growth, part of what's attractive now about having a coast-to-coast business is, in markets that have been carefully curated by us and where we want to be, is two things happen now. One, our aperture relative to bolt-on transactions has been opened considerably. And of course, bolt-on transactions, if you think about a return on investment, being able to get very quick synergies, that's really the best type of transaction you can do. But here's the glory of it. Almost any transaction we would do now is going to be a bolt-on, whether it's a single site or whether it's multiple sites. So I think where we positioned ourselves tactically and strategically for future growth is actually very important. I will tell you we are engaged in a number of what we feel like are very meaningful conversations today, separate and distinct from the dialogue that's ongoing relative to our discontinued operations that I mentioned before. And the dialogues in which we're engaged are primarily, if not almost exclusively, on the aggregate side. So should you expect us to continue growing our aggregates footprint? Absolutely. Will we ever surprise you? I think not, because we've largely said where we want to grow and why we want to grow there. So do we have an appetite for it? We do. And one reason we have an appetite for it, and I mean this as a compliment to our team, they're good at it. They're good at identifying businesses.

You know, the thing that I think is important for us to continue to focus on is we've made a number of changes. We're going to focus on those 11 brands that are really the biggest drivers of our success. That's a bit of a change. Frankly, we probably peanut buttered our efforts a little too broadly in the past, and we're going to focus on those brands that we believe have real growth potential for the long term. We're also going to do a bit more promotional spend than we have in the past, particularly on brands like Woodbridge, where that's an important part of the consumer dynamic. A lot of work and research has been done in the last few months to make sure that we understand all the consumer dynamics around our critical brands, and we will execute against those dynamics in this coming year.

So and we are disclosing that them and usually on a fairly frequent basis how that map is growing. As you've seen, we have launched fairly few markets the first half.

There are some clips talking about some politicians talking about banning fracking. And, you know, this is a time for us as industry and as Americans to hold leaders accountable for statements that I think are really damaging and cause completely unintended impacts. I mean, as it relates to hydraulic fracturing and the ban of that, we cannot ignore the science on this. Over 10 years, it's been studied under the Obama administration. The EPA put out a report saying hydraulic fracturing is safe. And understanding the implications of these type of decisions, 98% of the wells in this country require hydraulic fracturing. That goes away, you snap your fingers, and the production in the United States, which we fought for decades to create America as an energy powerhouse, would sort of evaporate and we'd see production in this country drop 35%. That's going to lead to a lot of terrible things. And the ironic thing is, as an oil and gas operator, this is a price times volume game. Our production at EQT would go down, call it 25% or corporate decline, but price would skyrocket. And that's the tough part here is that It would actually be constructive for prices, but it'd be bad for Americans. And that's why we need to make sure our politicians are putting the right policies in place. And with all the crazy things that are happening in this world, we're really encouraged to see that energy is still at the top of the list as a key issue for American voters. And it's something that we need to take very seriously.",2371.867,2490.599,Answer,pair_10,EQT,2024,Q2,Risk Factors
30,spk12,Unknown,Unknown,"Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So you touched on the topic of Medicare risk adjuster payments earlier. This was also a little bit more topical about a month ago with the Wall Street Journal putting a spotlight on it. So I guess I'm just curious if you have any updated high-level thoughts on MRA payments conceptually for the managed care industry overall. And do you see any potential reform of MRA near term, or do you expect a status quo going forward? Thanks.",2715.598,2741.29,Question,pair_13,UNH,2021,Q3,Risk Factors
31,spk18,Carrie Holford,Berenberg,"Hi. Thank you. Two questions for me on Bithynia, please. Firstly, on price, the increase in demand this quarter, was said to be partially offset by lower realized prices. And that contrasts with the comments in Q2 where you detailed a higher realized price. So I'm wondering if you could just talk a bit more about those dynamics and whether that's influenced in any way by the upcoming adjuvant launch. And then secondly, on the adjuvant situation, I know Barty has commented on that call earlier today. that the FDA has stated to them that submission based on IDFS alone will be sufficient as long as there's no detrimental effect on OS. And that, I think, appears to be in contrast to your experience. But perhaps there'd be a more relaxed approach than the FDA route that has been set out so far. So I'm just curious as to why you think that might be. Any feedback you can give there?",4113.528,4184.719,Question,pair_8,LLY,2021,Q3,Risk Factors
32,spk10,,,"Yep. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There's a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you're aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. Are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process in particular like EU and maybe China? And in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And How should we think about timing then including that and have a follow-up? Thank you.",,,Question, pair_17,AAPL,2020, Q2,Risk Factors
