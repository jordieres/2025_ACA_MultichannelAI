        "Question": "Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are? And what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter a new iPhone cycle? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.",
        "Answer": "Yes. Hi, Eric. The install base hit an all-time high during the quarter, and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency, and the 15, as you point out, If you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple intelligence, we are very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.",

        "Question": "Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare, you know, that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole, how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.",
        "Answer": "Yeah, Eric, as you point out, we decreased by six and a half percent year over year for the whole of greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than three. So over 50 percent of the decline year over year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year. And so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for greater China, the install base set a record. We also in mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders. And so that's a very strong signal. And in fact, from Kantar, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. ALSO, IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOK AT IS THE 15 FAMILY COMPARED TO THE 14 FAMILY FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF WEEKS FROM LAUNCH. SO THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE SEPTEMBER of 23. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, One of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in mainland China, the majority of customers buying are buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time. And the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in greater China as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long term.",

Lack of relevance to financial reporting: The text discusses the rollout of a product feature called Apple Intelligence and its potential impact on developers. This has no direct connection to financial reporting or the SEC Form 10-K.\n2. No mention of financial metrics or trends: There are no financial metrics, such as revenue, net income, or assets, mentioned in the excerpt. Additionally, there is no discussion of financial trends, challenges, or strategies that would be typical in a category like [MD&A].\n3.

        "Question": "Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, with regard to gross margin, you know, it's been, you know, there's been some component price inflation and mix. mind just you know giving us a little more color on how you're you're managing that sequentially and uh um and you know how you how you feel about the current component environment uh as an impact on margins thanks sure man i think i'll give you a bit of the walk for the june quarter and then get into the the outlook that we provided for the september quarter and",
        "Answer": "At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix within products. Of course, you know, we launched a very important product like the iPad during the course of the quarter, but we had an offset from a shift in mix towards services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a... year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5 to 46.5, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again, similar dynamics. We expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodities side, I think that's what you're referring to. Yes, we've seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel we're well-positioned, and as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us, and we're pleased where we are.",

Thank you.",
        "Answer": "You know, we are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it's another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the carriers themselves to answer, but I believe it will be a very key time for a compelling upgrade cycle.",

And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next generation iPhone?",

        "Question": "You know, your services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it's accelerated recently. Can you just talk about, you know, when you look at this double-digit growth, How much of that do you think is coming from the install-based growth versus, you know, better ARPU or better monetization of the install-based? And, you know, how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?",
        "Answer": "Yes, I mean, it's Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The install base growth is very important, of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our services. We are seeing, and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now, we see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people. using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements we see paid accounts growing double digits and we've seen that for many many quarters now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform and they're growing strong double digits as well. So obviously the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARCU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time and we've launched many new services fairly recently. Obviously our payments business is relatively new Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we're providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem And we believe we're doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We're launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that. As we go forward, we're very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because particularly if you look at the performance that we had in services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.",

How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships? where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners, but you're obviously, they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive install base. So in the long term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part, the services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time, or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I will follow up.",
        "Answer": "I think the way that I look at it is that Apple intelligence is the on-device processing and the private cloud compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially. And that will be focused on world knowledge, as I said.

As a follow-up, maybe for Luca, just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again, if I look at calendar 23, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, we've been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwinds, I mean, there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years, so XFX. Are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.",
        "Answer": "Yeah, of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be, and this is incremental on a year-over-year basis, and it's one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures, but it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the products business, our products have different margins profiles, and depending on their relative success in the marketplace, our products gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products is, as an impact on gross margins. Right. And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, you know, we just launched an iPad and that, you know, is, you know, as one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact, is the state of the commodity markets. And they tend to go in cycles. And so we'll see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business. And we think we're in a good position there. Thanks, Lupo.",

And then I have a quick follow-up.",
        "Answer": "Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously if you look at the Mac it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020 and the iPad is the is the same and so it starts with the the M series of silicon and And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.",

And that's going to surface Apple intelligence in a way that is natural to the user and in a way that will I think get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think it's profound.

        "Answer": "Well, we have, you know, provided Let me repeat what we provided. We think that we're going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%. In spite of the fact that we're going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there's a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the MAC data, that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. And clearly, we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro.

My question is, in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features, so are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18, or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?",
        "Answer": "Our objective that we said in June is to roll out U.S. English starting in the fall, and that's to users. and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a timeframe that, and we're tracking to that.",

        "Question": "I understand. And the next one for Luca, Luca, the services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DNA rules?",
        "Answer": "Well, as you know, we've introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we have seen a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It's obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again, to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.",

        "Question": "Yep. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There's a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you're aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. Are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process in particular like EU and maybe China? And in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And How should we think about timing then including that and have a follow-up? Thank you.",
        "Answer": "We're engaged as you would guess with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously, because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and committed, scheduled to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both. Yeah, got it.",

        "Question": "And a quick one on the wearables category, Luca, I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of which category is true of the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis. Thank you.",
        "Answer": "Yeah, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the wearables, home and accessory categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year, had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE, and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it's important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however, and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it's grown, the wearables home and accessory business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.",

        "Question": "Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity and Is it even possible to forecast the services usage as they roll out, given that they're so new for consumers? Thanks.",
        "Answer": "Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We've been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here is, you know, it's increasing year over year. On the CapEx part, it's important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach where we do things internally, and we have certain partners that we do business with externally, where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean, you can expect that there's, we will continue to invest and increase it year on year.",

        "Question": "Okay, and maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they're up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the services mix or cost controls is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?",
        "Answer": "Yeah, I'm glad you noticed that. We are... pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return on capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's the combination of a number of things. Of course, you know, an improvement in the top line helps. The margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow on the CapEx front. As Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay as we go. But in general, we try to... to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we're pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.",
