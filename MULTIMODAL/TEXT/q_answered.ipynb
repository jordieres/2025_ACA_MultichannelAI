So how are you thinking about the next legs of services growth as you move into the next three to five years? And then for you, Luca, NAN prices are falling this year. Services mix is rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins and yet We're seeing gross margins sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds, and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher?

We had double-digit services growth in all of the geographic segment. And the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, Cloud Services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records. And, of course, subscriptions have now passed over 300 million, as I had mentioned before. And so we couldn't be happier with how things are going. In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well.

       "Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? ASPs were above expectations, you know, and now that you've had – And that was clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. Now that you've had about nine months of experience with a, you know, high-end, fully-featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is, and, you know, how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a follow-up.\n",
       "\n",
       "**📌 Answer:**\n",
       "Yeah. Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%. And if you look, for the cycle, and by the cycle I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis growth in units of sort of mid-single digit and ASP growth of double digit. And so if you look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it. And we're really, we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch. And so we feel terrific about iPhone 10. If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone 10, the 8, and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP, and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle we've learned that customers want innovative products, and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in time, but it just – puts an explanation point by that, I believe, with looking at the results. At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter, and so when we changed some of the configurations, the memory configurations in the year-ago quarter, if you look at it on a geographic basis, The top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone 10 was number one and has been for a couple of quarters. And iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the US, UK and Japan. And so, you know, it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.\n",

       "And then can you talk a bit about China, greater China, up 19% year over year during the quarter, I believe, You know, obviously iPhone doing well, but, you know, some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted. It doesn't seem like that. So I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward. Thank you.\n",
       "\n",
       "**📌 Answer:**\n",
       "Yeah, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double-digit growth in greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and sort of the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad. But if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double-digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category, which the watch did extremely well. And so there are lots of good things happening there in terms of the – The tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure that a lot of some people have questions on this. Our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex, and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing. But we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that. And so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period, I think there's one that's exiting today, there had been three of those, and maybe I could walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody's on the same page. The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum that was many, many different countries. That started, I believe, at the beginning of June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. There is a fourth tariff. which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one, and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. It's actually a tedious process in going through it, because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing. And so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results. later on those and feeding back public comment. Of course, the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue, such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries, or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. All of this said, We're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out, because there's an inescapable mutuality between the US and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together. Each country can only prosper if the other does, and of course the world needs both US and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this, and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.\n",

       "Tim, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original content strategy and also Apple Music, if you can give us a little more colors or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out.\n",
       "\n",
       "**📌 Answer:**\n",
       "Yeah, sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world, there's sort of no match. And we think that we can do some great in original content together. And so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet. But I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer. In terms of the key catalyst and the changes, the cord cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this, like Apple TV units and revenue grew by very strong double digits in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are within the 300 million plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions, and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year over year. And so all the things from a all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry and so we're really happy to be working on something but just not ready to talk about it in depth today. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial. And so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us, or what we've been told, is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter. And we have leadership position in Japan. And so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time, we're doing quite well. But really, the key thing in music is not the competition between companies that are providing music. The real challenge is to grow the market. Because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well. And I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, That will be a beneficiary of that, as other people will as well. But I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50%, as I mentioned earlier, during the quarter. And so some really, really strong, strong results.\n",

And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. You know, I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod, but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad. And so I think home is important. Home is important. Work is important. The movement between the two are important. Health is important. The smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it. And so I think all of those are important, and we're focused on all of them.\n",

And so the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided, you know, I really want something to – to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth, like the watch desk as well. And so it's not always a linear path. I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.\n",
