        This method takes the CSV files generated in the previous step, where interventions are already classified into 
        question-answer pairs. Each intervention that belongs to a question-answer pair is further classified into one 
        of the following SEC 10-K report topics:

        Categories:
            [Business]: Outlines the company's operations, including its main products/services, target markets, market presence, and strategic objectives.
            [Risk Factors]: Identifies significant risks (market, regulatory, financial) that could adversely affect the company's stability or performance.
            [Selected Financial Data]: Highlights key financial metrics (revenue, net income, assets) over recent years, offering a high-level financial snapshot.
            [MD&A]: Analyzes financial results, explaining trends, challenges, and strategies, and provides management's perspective on future performance.
            [Financial Statements and Supplementary Data]: Contains audited financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) and detailed notes adhering to accounting standards.
            [Other]: If none of the previous categories fits with the message of the text.

        For each observation:
                - The assigned category and the model's confidence score (1 - uncertainty) will be stored.
                - If the category is [Other], an explanation from the model will be included to justify why the intervention does not match any of the other categories.

        The resulting classifications are stored in a JSON file located in the same directory as the input CSV file.

        Processes all input CSV files using both the QA and 10-K classifiers sequentially.

        First, it processes the input files for question-answer classification using the QA classifier:
            - The resulting CSV files will have additional columns:
                1. A column indicating whether each intervention is classified as a question, answer, or procedure.
                2. A column specifying the question-answer pair to which the intervention belongs, if applicable.

        Next, it processes these expanded CSV files for SEC 10-K classification using the 10-K classifier:
            - Each question-answer pair (first question, then answer) is classified into one of six categories
            - The results are stored in a JSON file alongside the input CSV, detailing the classification and additional metadata for each detected question-answer pair.

        Returns:
            None: All results are saved as expanded CSV files and corresponding JSON files in the specified directories.
